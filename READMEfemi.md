Structure Analysis of Mutation Effect on Selected Proteins
---

SETD5 (Isoform 1): 1500a.a
-----
- BLASTp result: 1 hit -> Penicilin-binding protein activator LpoA (C6CMD7.1)
![setd5-blast-hit](sedt5-blast-hit.png)
> Analysis: Low max and total score, low coverage, plus high E-value (2.4) (although relatively 
high percent identity) imply hit is highly likely a random match. Hence hit cannot be used as 
template for SETD5 homology modeling. Thus a de novo modeling strategy is required.

LEIG1 (Leucine-rich repeat)
-----
- BLASTp result: 6 hits
![lrig1](lrig1-blast-hit.png)
> Analysis: Although E-value appears to be low, indicating true hits, all hits are non-human proteins
Again, de novo modeling is adviced.

PHF20L1
-----
- No BLAST hits: Hence de novo modeling is adviced
