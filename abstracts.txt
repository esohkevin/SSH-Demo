BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax contains approximately 5400 coding genes, more than 
40% of which code for hypothetical proteins that have not been functionally
characterized. In a previous preliminary screening using pooled serum samples,
numerous hypothetical proteins were selected from among those that were highly
transcribed in the schizont-stage of parasites, and highly antigenic P. vivax
candidates including hypothetical proteins were identified. However, their
immunological and functional activities in P. vivax remain unclear. From these
candidates, we investigated a P. vivax 50-kDa protein (Pv50, PVX_087140)
containing a highly conserved signal peptide that shows high transcription levels
in blood-stage parasites.
RESULTS: Recombinant Pv50 was expressed in a cell-free expression system and used
for IgG prevalence analysis of patients with vivax malaria and healthy
individuals. Immune responses were analyzed in immunized mice and mouse
antibodies were used to detect the subcellular localization of the protein in
blood-stage parasites by immunofluorescence assay. A protein array method was
used to evaluate protein-protein interactions to predict protein functional
activities during the invasion of parasites into erythrocytes. Recombinant Pv50
showed IgG prevalence in patient samples with a sensitivity of 42.9% and
specificity of 93.8% compared to that in healthy individuals. The non-cytophilic 
antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 were the major components involved in the antibody
response in Pv50-immunized mice. Pv50 localized on the surface of merozoites and 
a specific interaction between Pv50 and PvMSP1 was detected, suggesting that
Pv50-PvMSP1 forms a heterodimeric complex in P. vivax.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased immune responses caused by native P. vivax parasites were 
detected, confirming its immunogenic effects. This study provides a method for
detecting new malaria antigens, and Pv50 may be a vivax malaria vaccine candidate
with PvMSP1.

In an effort to control and eventually eliminate malaria, the development of
transmission-blocking vaccines has long been sought. However, few antigens have
been evaluated in clinical trials, often due to limitations in the expression and
purification of the antigen in sufficient yield and quality. Pfs230, a surface
antigen of gametocytes, has recently advanced to clinical evaluation as a
conjugate vaccine using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A carrier protein. 
Here we continue to build upon prior work of developing a Pfs230 candidate in the
baculovirus system, Pfs230C1 (aa 443-731), through systematic process development
efforts to improve yield and purity. Various insect cells including High Five,
Sf9 and Super Sf9 were first evaluated for quality and quantity of antigen, along
with three insect cell media. In the selection of Sf9 cells, an intact Pfs230C1
was expressed and harvested at 48 h for downstream development. A downstream
process, utilizing immobilized metal affinity column (IMAC), followed by ion
exchange (IEX) membranes (Mustang S) and finally IEX chromatography (DEAE)
yielded a pure Pfs230C1 protein. The complete process was repeated three times at
the 20 L scale. To support the eventual chemistry manufacturing and controls
(CMC) of Pfs230C1, analytical tools, including monoclonal antibodies, were
developed to characterize the identity, integrity, and purity of Pfs230C1. These 
analytical tools, taken in combination with the optimized process, were
implemented with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) in mind with the
ultimate objective of Phase I clinical trials.

Malaria symptoms and pathology are initiated by invasion of host erythrocytes by 
Plasmodium merozoites in a complex process that involves interactions between
parasite and host erythrocyte proteins. Erythrocyte invasion presents attractive 
targets for malaria vaccine and drug development. Recently it was observed that
antibodies against PfMSA180 (PF3D7_1014100) are associated with protection from
symptomatic malaria, suggesting that this protein is a target of naturally
acquired protective antibodies. Here we characterize PfMSA180, a ~170 kDa
merozoite surface antigen that is potentially involved in erythrocyte invasion.
PfMSA180 synthesized by the wheat germ cell-free system was used to raise
antibodies in rabbits. Growth inhibition assays revealed that parasite invasion
is inhibited by antibodies to the PfMSA180 C-terminal region, which contains an
erythrocyte-binding domain. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that
PfMSA180 specifically interacts with human erythrocyte integrin associated
protein (CD47), suggesting that PfMSA180 plays a role during merozoite invasion
of erythrocytes. Polymorphism analysis revealed that pfmsa180 is highly conserved
among field isolates. We show that naturally acquired PfMSA180-specific
antibodies responses are associated with protective immunity in a malaria-exposed
Thai population. In sum, the data presented here supports further evaluation of
the conserved erythrocyte-binding C-terminal region of PfMSA180 as an asexual
blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate.

P. falciparum cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (PfCelTOS) is 
an advanced vaccine candidate that has a crucial role in the traversal of the
malaria parasite in both mosquito and mammalian hosts. As recombinant purified
proteins are normally poor immunogens, they require to be admixed with
adjuvant(s); therefore, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the
capacity of different vaccine adjuvants, MPL, CpG, and QS-21 alone or in
combination MPL/CpG/QS-21 (MCQ) on the enhancement of the immunogenicity of E.
coli-expressed PfCelTOS in BALB/c mice. This goal was achieved by the assessment 
of the anti-PfCelTOS IgG antibodies (level, titer, its IgG isotypes profile, its 
avidity, and its persistence), and the extracellular Th1 cytokines using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in post-immunized BALB/c mouse sera and
PfCelTOS-stimulated splenocytes, respectively. Also, the assessment of
transmission-reducing activity (TRA) of anti-PfCelTOS obtained from different
vaccine groups was carried out in female Anopheles stephensi by using standard
membrane feeding assay (SMFA). In comparison to PfCelTOS alone, administration of
PfCelTOS with three distinct Th1 potent adjuvants in vaccine mouse groups showed 
enhancement and improvement of PfCelTOS immunogenicity that generated a more bias
toward Th1 response with significantly enhanced titer and avidity of the
anti-PfCelTOS responses that could impair the ookinete development in An.
stephensi. However, the mice immunized with PfCelTOS in MCQ mixture adjuvants
resulted in the highest induction of antibody titers, avidity, and inhibitory
antibodies in oocysts development (88%/26.7% reductions in intensity/prevalence) 
in An. stephensi It could be suggested that adjuvant combinations with different 
mechanisms stimulate better functional antibody responses than using adjuvants
individually against challenging diseases such as malaria.

BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 3α (PvMSP3α) is a
promising vaccine candidate which has shown strong association with
immunogenicity and protectiveness. Its use is however complicated by evolutionary
plasticity features which enhance immune evasion. Low complexity regions (LCRs)
provide plasticity in surface proteins of Plasmodium species, but its implication
in vaccine design remain unexplored. Here population genetic, comparative
phylogenetic and structural biology analysis was performed on the gene encoding
PvMSP3α.
RESULTS: Three LCRs were found in PvMSP3α block II. Both the predicted tertiary
structure of the protein and the phylogenetic trees based on this region were
influenced by the presence of the LCRs. The LCRs were mainly B cell epitopes
within or adjacent. In addition a repeat motif mimicking one of the B cell
epitopes was found within the PvMSP3a block II low complexity region. This
particular B cell epitope also featured rampant alanine substitutions which might
impair antibody binding.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that PvMSP3α block II possesses LCRs which
might confer a strong phenotypic plasticity. The phenomenon of phenotypic
plasticity and implication of LCRs in malaria immunology in general and vaccine
candidate genes in particular merits further exploration.

Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum is contributed by many known and unknown
factors. Lack of effective vaccine and rise in drug-resistant Plasmodium
parasites leads to the major challenge in controlling the parasite. Determination
of surface or secreted proteins which are essential for the survival of the
pathogen is a very important step in finding potential vaccine candidates.
Despite the discovery of several vaccine candidates against Plasmodium over the
last decades, an effective vaccine is not available. The present study
hypothesized that the PRE-binding protein (PREBP) could be a potential vaccine
candidate against malaria pathogenesis. PREBP is highly conserved among the class
Aconoidasida and exhibit high antigenicity and accessibility as a secretory
protein. The present hypothesis was tested by employing in-silico translational
genomics wherein the antigenicity, localization and the conservancy were
determined.

Immunization with sporozoites under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis (CPS) induces
distinctly preerythrocytic and long-lasting sterile protection against homologous
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). To identify possible humoral immune
correlates of protection, plasma samples were collected from 38 CPS-immunized
Dutch volunteers for analysis using a whole Plasmodium falciparum proteome
microarray with 7,455 full-length or segmented protein features displaying about 
91% of the total P. falciparum proteome. We identified 548 reactive antigens
representing 483 unique proteins. Using the breadth of antibody responses for
each subject in a mixture-model algorithm, we observed a trimodal pattern, with
distinct groups of 16 low responders, 19 medium responders, and 3 high
responders. Fifteen out of 16 low responders, 12 of the 19 medium responders, and
3 out of 3 high responders were fully protected from a challenge infection. In
the medium-responder group, we identified six novel antigens associated with
protection (area under the curve [AUC] value of ≥0.75; P < 0.05) and six other
antigens that were specifically increased in nonprotected volunteers (AUC value
of ≤0.25; P < 0.05). When used in combination, the multiantigen classifier
predicts CPS-induced protective efficacy with 83% sensitivity and 88%
specificity. The antibody response patterns characterized in this study represent
surrogate markers that may provide rational guidance for clinical vaccine
development.IMPORTANCE Infection by Plasmodium parasites has been a major cause
of mortality and morbidity in humans for thousands of years. Despite the
considerable reduction of deaths, according to the WHO, over 5 billion people are
still at risk, with about 216 million worldwide cases occurring in 2016. More
compelling, 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa bore 80% of the worldwide malaria 
burden. Complete eradication has been challenging, and the development of an
affordable and effective vaccine will go a long way in achieving elimination.
However, identifying vaccine candidate targets has been difficult. In the present
study, we use a highly effective immunization protocol that confers long-lasting 
sterile immunity in combination with a whole P. falciparum proteome microarray to
identify antibody responses associated with protection. This study characterizes 
a novel antibody profile associated with sterile protective immunity and trimodal
humoral responses that sheds light on the possible mechanism of CPS-induced
immunity against P. falciparum parasites.

BACKGROUND: In the current scenario, designing of world-wide effective malaria
vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum remain challenging despite the significant 
progress has been made in last few decades. Conventional vaccinology (isolate,
inactivate and inject) approaches are time consuming, laborious and expensive;
therefore, the use of computational vaccinology tools are imperative, which can
facilitate the design of new and promising vaccine candidates.
RESULTS: In current investigation, initially 5548 proteins of P. falciparum
genome were carefully chosen for the incidence of signal peptide/ anchor using
SignalP4.0 tool that resulted into 640 surface linked proteins (SLP). Out of
these SLP, only 17 were predicted to contain GPI-anchors using PredGPI tool in
which further 5 proteins were considered as malarial antigenic adhesins by MAAP
and VaxiJen programs, respectively. In the subsequent step, T cell epitopes of 5 
genome derived predicted antigenic adhesins (GDPAA) and 5 randomly selected known
malarial adhesins (RSKMA) were analysed employing MHC class I and II tools of
IEDB analysis resource. Finally, VaxiJen scored T cell epitopes from each antigen
were considered for prediction of population coverage (PPC) analysis in the
world-wide population including malaria endemic regions. The validation of the
present in silico strategy was carried out by comparing the PPC of combined (MHC 
class I and II) predicted epitope ensemble among GDPAA (99.97%), RSKMA (99.90%)
and experimentally known epitopes (EKE) of P. falciparum (97.72%) pertaining to
world-wide human population.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study systematically screened 5 potential protective
antigens from P. falciparum genome using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly,
these GDPAA, RSKMA and EKE of P. falciparum epitope ensembles forecasted to
contain highly promiscuous T cell epitopes, which are potentially effective for
most of the world-wide human population with malaria endemic regions. Therefore, 
these epitope ensembles could be considered in near future for novel and
significantly effective vaccine candidate against malaria.

BACKGROUND: A malaria vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane
antigen 1 (AMA1) elicited strain specific efficacy in Malian children that waned 
in the second season after vaccination despite sustained AMA1 antibody titers.
With the goal of identifying a humoral correlate of vaccine-induced protection,
pre- and post-vaccination sera from children vaccinated with the AMA1 vaccine and
from a control group that received a rabies vaccine were tested for AMA1-specific
immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and for antibody
avidity.
METHODS: Samples from a previously completed Phase 2 AMA1 vaccine trial in
children residing in Mali, West Africa were used to determine AMA1-specific IgG
subclass antibody titers and avidity by ELISA. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to assess correlation between IgG subclass antibody titers and risk of 
time to first or only clinical malaria episode and risk of multiple episodes.
Asexual P. falciparum parasite density measured for each child as area under the 
curve were used to assess correlation between IgG subclass antibody titers and
parasite burden.
RESULTS: AMA1 vaccination did not elicit a change in antibody avidity; however,
AMA1 vaccinees had a robust IgG subclass response that persisted over the malaria
transmission season. AMA1-specific IgG subclass responses were not associated
with decreased risk of subsequent clinical malaria. For the AMA1 vaccine group,
IgG3 levels at study day 90 correlated with high parasite burden during days
90-240. In the control group, AMA1-specific IgG subclass rise and persistence
over the malaria season was modest and correlated with age. In the control group,
titers of several IgG subclasses at days 90 and 240 correlated with parasite
burden over the first 90 study days, and IgG3 at day 240 correlated with parasite
burden during days 90-240.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither IgG subclass nor avidity was associated with the modest,
strain-specific efficacy elicited by this blood stage malaria vaccine. Although a
correlate of protection was not identified, correlations between subclass titers 
and age, and correlations between IgG subclass titers and parasite burden,
defined by area under the curve parasitaemia levels, were observed, which expand 
knowledge about IgG subclass responses. IgG3, known to have the shortest
half-life of the IgG subclasses, might be the most temporally relevant indicator 
of ongoing malaria exposure when examining antibody responses to AMA1.

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA-140) plays a role in
tight junction formation during parasite invasion of red blood cells and is a
potential vaccine candidate for malaria. Individuals in areas where malaria is
endemic possess EBA-140-specific antibodies, and individuals with high antibody
titers to this protein have a lower rate of reinfection by parasites. The red
blood cell binding segment of EBA-140 is comprised of two Duffy-binding-like
domains, called F1 and F2, that together create region II. The sialic
acid-binding pocket of F1 is essential for binding, whereas the sialic
acid-binding pocket in F2 appears dispensable. Here, we show that immunization of
mice with the complete region II results in poorly neutralizing antibodies. In
contrast, immunization of mice with the functionally relevant F1 domain of region
II results in antibodies that confer a 2-fold increase in parasite neutralization
compared to that of the F2 domain. Epitope mapping of diverse F1 and F2
monoclonal antibodies revealed that the functionally relevant F1 sialic
acid-binding pocket is a privileged site inaccessible to antibodies, that the F2 
sialic acid-binding pocket contains a nonneutralizing epitope, and that two
additional epitopes reside in F1 on the opposite face from the sialic
acid-binding pocket. These studies indicate that focusing the immune response to 
the functionally important F1 sialic acid binding pocket improves the protective 
immune response of EBA-140. These results have implications for improving future 
vaccine designs and emphasize the importance of structural vaccinology for
malaria.

High-density peptide arrays are an excellent means to profile anti-plasmodial
antibody responses. Different protein intrinsic epitopes can be distinguished,
and additional insights are gained, when compared with assays involving the
full-length protein. Distinct reactivities to specific epitopes within one
protein may explain differences in published results, regarding immunity or
susceptibility to malaria. We pursued three approaches to find specific epitopes 
within important plasmodial proteins, (1) twelve leading vaccine candidates were 
mapped as overlapping 15-mer peptides, (2) a bioinformatical approach served to
predict immunogenic malaria epitopes which were subsequently validated in the
assay, and (3) randomly selected peptides from the malaria proteome were screened
as a control. Several peptide array replicas were prepared, employing
particle-based laser printing, and were used to screen 27 serum samples from a
malaria-endemic area in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The immunological status of
the individuals was classified as "protected" or "unprotected" based on clinical 
symptoms, parasite density, and age. The vaccine candidate screening approach
resulted in significant hits in all twelve proteins and allowed us (1) to verify 
many known immunogenic structures, (2) to map B-cell epitopes across the entire
sequence of each antigen and (3) to uncover novel immunogenic epitopes.
Predicting immunogenic regions in the proteome of the human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum, via the bioinformatics approach and subsequent array
screening, confirmed known immunogenic sequences, such as in the leading malaria 
vaccine candidate CSP and discovered immunogenic epitopes derived from
hypothetical or unknown proteins.

Background: Malaria in pregnancy has major impacts on mother and child health.
The current strategy to prevent pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) comprises
intermittent preventive treatment and use of impregnated bednets. To complement
existing interventions, we developed a malaria vaccine candidate aiming at
reducing sequestration of asexual "blood-stage" parasites in the placenta, the
major virulence mechanism in PAM.
Methods: PAMVAC is a vaccine candidate based on a recombinant fragment of
VAR2CSA, the Plasmodium falciparum protein responsible for binding to the
placenta via chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Healthy, adult malaria-naive volunteers
were immunized with three intramuscular injections of 20 μg (n=9) or 50 μg (n=27)
PAMVAC, adjuvanted either with Alhydrogel, or with Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant 
in stable emulsion (GLA-SE) or in a liposomal formulation with QS21 (GLA-LSQ).
Allocation to the three formulations was random and double-blind. Vaccines were
given every four weeks. Volunteers were observed for six months following last
immunization.
Results: All PAMVAC formulations were safe and well tolerated. Altogether, 262
adverse events (AE) occurred in 36/36 volunteers, 94 (ten Grade 2, two Grade 3)
at least possibly related to the vaccine. No Serious AE occurred. Distribution
and severity of AE were similar in all arms. PAMVAC was immunogenic in all
participants. PAMVAC-specific antibody levels were highest with PAMVAC-GLA-SE.
The antibodies inhibited binding of VAR2CSA expressing P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes to CSA in a standardized functional assay.
Conclusions: PAMVAC formulated with Alhydrogel or GLA-based adjuvants was safe,
well-tolerated and induced functionally active antibodies. PAMVAC will next be
assessed in women before first pregnancies in an endemic area.

Malaria remains one the world's most deadly infectious diseases, with almost half
a million deaths and over 150 million clinical cases each year. An effective
vaccine would contribute enormously to malaria control and will almost certainly 
be required for eventual eradication of the disease. However, the leading malaria
vaccine candidate, RTS,S, shows only 30-50% efficacy under field conditions,
making it less cost-effective than long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets.
Other subunit malaria vaccine candidates, including TRAP-based vaccines, show no 
better protective efficacy. This has led to increased interest in combining
subunit malaria vaccines as a means of enhancing protective efficacy.
Mathematical models of the effect of combining such vaccines on protective
efficacy can help inform optimal vaccine strategies and decision-making at all
stages of the clinical process. So far, however, no such model has been developed
for pre-clinical murine studies, the stage at which all candidate antigens and
combinations begin evaluation. To address this gap, this paper develops a
mathematical model of vaccine combination adapted to murine malaria studies. The 
model is based on simple probabilistic assumptions which put the model on a
firmer theoretical footing than previous clinical models, which rather than
deriving a relationship between immune responses and protective efficacy posit
the relationship to be either exponential or Hill curves. Data from pre-clinical 
murine malaria studies are used to derive values for unknowns in the model which 
in turn allows simulations of vaccine combination efficacy and suggests optimal
strategies to pursue. Finally, the ability of the model to shed light on
fundamental biological variables of murine malaria such as the blood stage growth
rate and sporozoite infectivity is explored.

Passive transfer studies in humans clearly demonstrated the protective role of
IgG antibodies against malaria. Identifying the precise parasite antigens that
mediate immunity is essential for vaccine design, but has proved difficult.
Completion of the Plasmodium falciparum genome revealed thousands of potential
vaccine candidates, but a significant bottleneck remains in their validation and 
prioritization for further evaluation in clinical trials. Focusing initially on
the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite proteome, we used peer-reviewed publications,
multiple proteomic and bioinformatic approaches, to select and prioritize
potential immune targets. We expressed 109 P. falciparum recombinant proteins,
the majority of which were obtained using a mammalian expression system that has 
been shown to produce biologically functional extracellular proteins, and used
them to create KILchip v1.0: a novel protein microarray to facilitate
high-throughput multiplexed antibody detection from individual samples. The
microarray assay was highly specific; antibodies against P. falciparum proteins
were detected exclusively in sera from malaria-exposed but not malaria-naïve
individuals. The intensity of antibody reactivity varied as expected from strong 
to weak across well-studied antigens such as AMA1 and RH5 (Kruskal-Wallis H test 
for trend: p < 0.0001). The inter-assay and intra-assay variability was minimal, 
with reproducible results obtained in re-assays using the same chip over a
duration of 3 months. Antibodies quantified using the multiplexed format in
KILchip v1.0 were highly correlated with those measured in the gold-standard
monoplex ELISA [median (range) Spearman's R of 0.84 (0.65-0.95)]. KILchip v1.0 is
a robust, scalable and adaptable protein microarray that has broad applicability 
to studies of naturally acquired immunity against malaria by providing a
standardized tool for the detection of antibody correlates of protection. It will
facilitate rapid high-throughput validation and prioritization of potential
Plasmodium falciparum merozoite-stage antigens paving the way for urgently needed
clinical trials for the next generation of malaria vaccines.

Merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) is a potential vaccine candidate against
malaria, although its functional role is yet to be elucidated. Previous studies
showed that MSP2 can interact with membranes, which may facilitate merozoite
invasion into the host cell. The N-terminal 25 residues of MSP2 (MSP21-25 ),
which may be aggregated on the merozoite surface, play a key role in the
interaction with membranes. Here, we investigated the effects of MSP21-25
-membrane interactions on the conformation and aggregation of MSP21-25 and on
membrane integrity, using nanodiscs and small unilamellar vesicles as mimetics of
cell membranes. MSP21-25 -membrane interactions induced the peptide to form
β-structure and to aggregate, depending on the lipid composition of the membrane.
Nonfibrillar aggregates in turn disrupted the membrane.
