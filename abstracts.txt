Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum is contributed by many known and unknown
factors. Lack of effective vaccine and rise in drug-resistant Plasmodium
parasites leads to the major challenge in controlling the parasite. Determination
of surface or secreted proteins which are essential for the survival of the
pathogen is a very important step in finding potential vaccine candidates.
Despite the discovery of several vaccine candidates against Plasmodium over the
last decades, an effective vaccine is not available. The present study
hypothesized that the PRE-binding protein (PREBP) could be a potential vaccine
candidate against malaria pathogenesis. PREBP is highly conserved among the class
Aconoidasida and exhibit high antigenicity and accessibility as a secretory
protein. The present hypothesis was tested by employing in-silico translational
genomics wherein the antigenicity, localization and the conservancy were
determined.

Immunization with sporozoites under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis (CPS) induces
distinctly preerythrocytic and long-lasting sterile protection against homologous
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). To identify possible humoral immune
correlates of protection, plasma samples were collected from 38 CPS-immunized
Dutch volunteers for analysis using a whole Plasmodium falciparum proteome
microarray with 7,455 full-length or segmented protein features displaying about 
91% of the total P. falciparum proteome. We identified 548 reactive antigens
representing 483 unique proteins. Using the breadth of antibody responses for
each subject in a mixture-model algorithm, we observed a trimodal pattern, with
distinct groups of 16 low responders, 19 medium responders, and 3 high
responders. Fifteen out of 16 low responders, 12 of the 19 medium responders, and
3 out of 3 high responders were fully protected from a challenge infection. In
the medium-responder group, we identified six novel antigens associated with
protection (area under the curve [AUC] value of ≥0.75; P < 0.05) and six other
antigens that were specifically increased in nonprotected volunteers (AUC value
of ≤0.25; P < 0.05). When used in combination, the multiantigen classifier
predicts CPS-induced protective efficacy with 83% sensitivity and 88%
specificity. The antibody response patterns characterized in this study represent
surrogate markers that may provide rational guidance for clinical vaccine
development.IMPORTANCE Infection by Plasmodium parasites has been a major cause
of mortality and morbidity in humans for thousands of years. Despite the
considerable reduction of deaths, according to the WHO, over 5 billion people are
still at risk, with about 216 million worldwide cases occurring in 2016. More
compelling, 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa bore 80% of the worldwide malaria 
burden. Complete eradication has been challenging, and the development of an
affordable and effective vaccine will go a long way in achieving elimination.
However, identifying vaccine candidate targets has been difficult. In the present
study, we use a highly effective immunization protocol that confers long-lasting 
sterile immunity in combination with a whole P. falciparum proteome microarray to
identify antibody responses associated with protection. This study characterizes 
a novel antibody profile associated with sterile protective immunity and trimodal
humoral responses that sheds light on the possible mechanism of CPS-induced
immunity against P. falciparum parasites.

BACKGROUND: In the current scenario, designing of world-wide effective malaria
vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum remain challenging despite the significant 
progress has been made in last few decades. Conventional vaccinology (isolate,
inactivate and inject) approaches are time consuming, laborious and expensive;
therefore, the use of computational vaccinology tools are imperative, which can
facilitate the design of new and promising vaccine candidates.
RESULTS: In current investigation, initially 5548 proteins of P. falciparum
genome were carefully chosen for the incidence of signal peptide/ anchor using
SignalP4.0 tool that resulted into 640 surface linked proteins (SLP). Out of
these SLP, only 17 were predicted to contain GPI-anchors using PredGPI tool in
which further 5 proteins were considered as malarial antigenic adhesins by MAAP
and VaxiJen programs, respectively. In the subsequent step, T cell epitopes of 5 
genome derived predicted antigenic adhesins (GDPAA) and 5 randomly selected known
malarial adhesins (RSKMA) were analysed employing MHC class I and II tools of
IEDB analysis resource. Finally, VaxiJen scored T cell epitopes from each antigen
were considered for prediction of population coverage (PPC) analysis in the
world-wide population including malaria endemic regions. The validation of the
present in silico strategy was carried out by comparing the PPC of combined (MHC 
class I and II) predicted epitope ensemble among GDPAA (99.97%), RSKMA (99.90%)
and experimentally known epitopes (EKE) of P. falciparum (97.72%) pertaining to
world-wide human population.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study systematically screened 5 potential protective
antigens from P. falciparum genome using bioinformatics tools. Interestingly,
these GDPAA, RSKMA and EKE of P. falciparum epitope ensembles forecasted to
contain highly promiscuous T cell epitopes, which are potentially effective for
most of the world-wide human population with malaria endemic regions. Therefore, 
these epitope ensembles could be considered in near future for novel and
significantly effective vaccine candidate against malaria.

BACKGROUND: A malaria vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane
antigen 1 (AMA1) elicited strain specific efficacy in Malian children that waned 
in the second season after vaccination despite sustained AMA1 antibody titers.
With the goal of identifying a humoral correlate of vaccine-induced protection,
pre- and post-vaccination sera from children vaccinated with the AMA1 vaccine and
from a control group that received a rabies vaccine were tested for AMA1-specific
immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) and for antibody
avidity.
METHODS: Samples from a previously completed Phase 2 AMA1 vaccine trial in
children residing in Mali, West Africa were used to determine AMA1-specific IgG
subclass antibody titers and avidity by ELISA. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to assess correlation between IgG subclass antibody titers and risk of 
time to first or only clinical malaria episode and risk of multiple episodes.
Asexual P. falciparum parasite density measured for each child as area under the 
curve were used to assess correlation between IgG subclass antibody titers and
parasite burden.
RESULTS: AMA1 vaccination did not elicit a change in antibody avidity; however,
AMA1 vaccinees had a robust IgG subclass response that persisted over the malaria
transmission season. AMA1-specific IgG subclass responses were not associated
with decreased risk of subsequent clinical malaria. For the AMA1 vaccine group,
IgG3 levels at study day 90 correlated with high parasite burden during days
90-240. In the control group, AMA1-specific IgG subclass rise and persistence
over the malaria season was modest and correlated with age. In the control group,
titers of several IgG subclasses at days 90 and 240 correlated with parasite
burden over the first 90 study days, and IgG3 at day 240 correlated with parasite
burden during days 90-240.
CONCLUSIONS: Neither IgG subclass nor avidity was associated with the modest,
strain-specific efficacy elicited by this blood stage malaria vaccine. Although a
correlate of protection was not identified, correlations between subclass titers 
and age, and correlations between IgG subclass titers and parasite burden,
defined by area under the curve parasitaemia levels, were observed, which expand 
knowledge about IgG subclass responses. IgG3, known to have the shortest
half-life of the IgG subclasses, might be the most temporally relevant indicator 
of ongoing malaria exposure when examining antibody responses to AMA1.

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen 140 (EBA-140) plays a role in
tight junction formation during parasite invasion of red blood cells and is a
potential vaccine candidate for malaria. Individuals in areas where malaria is
endemic possess EBA-140-specific antibodies, and individuals with high antibody
titers to this protein have a lower rate of reinfection by parasites. The red
blood cell binding segment of EBA-140 is comprised of two Duffy-binding-like
domains, called F1 and F2, that together create region II. The sialic
acid-binding pocket of F1 is essential for binding, whereas the sialic
acid-binding pocket in F2 appears dispensable. Here, we show that immunization of
mice with the complete region II results in poorly neutralizing antibodies. In
contrast, immunization of mice with the functionally relevant F1 domain of region
II results in antibodies that confer a 2-fold increase in parasite neutralization
compared to that of the F2 domain. Epitope mapping of diverse F1 and F2
monoclonal antibodies revealed that the functionally relevant F1 sialic
acid-binding pocket is a privileged site inaccessible to antibodies, that the F2 
sialic acid-binding pocket contains a nonneutralizing epitope, and that two
additional epitopes reside in F1 on the opposite face from the sialic
acid-binding pocket. These studies indicate that focusing the immune response to 
the functionally important F1 sialic acid binding pocket improves the protective 
immune response of EBA-140. These results have implications for improving future 
vaccine designs and emphasize the importance of structural vaccinology for
malaria.

High-density peptide arrays are an excellent means to profile anti-plasmodial
antibody responses. Different protein intrinsic epitopes can be distinguished,
and additional insights are gained, when compared with assays involving the
full-length protein. Distinct reactivities to specific epitopes within one
protein may explain differences in published results, regarding immunity or
susceptibility to malaria. We pursued three approaches to find specific epitopes 
within important plasmodial proteins, (1) twelve leading vaccine candidates were 
mapped as overlapping 15-mer peptides, (2) a bioinformatical approach served to
predict immunogenic malaria epitopes which were subsequently validated in the
assay, and (3) randomly selected peptides from the malaria proteome were screened
as a control. Several peptide array replicas were prepared, employing
particle-based laser printing, and were used to screen 27 serum samples from a
malaria-endemic area in Burkina Faso, West Africa. The immunological status of
the individuals was classified as "protected" or "unprotected" based on clinical 
symptoms, parasite density, and age. The vaccine candidate screening approach
resulted in significant hits in all twelve proteins and allowed us (1) to verify 
many known immunogenic structures, (2) to map B-cell epitopes across the entire
sequence of each antigen and (3) to uncover novel immunogenic epitopes.
Predicting immunogenic regions in the proteome of the human malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum, via the bioinformatics approach and subsequent array
screening, confirmed known immunogenic sequences, such as in the leading malaria 
vaccine candidate CSP and discovered immunogenic epitopes derived from
hypothetical or unknown proteins.

Merozoite surface proteins (MSPs) are considered as promising blood-stage malaria
vaccine candidates. MSP3 has long been evaluated for its vaccine candidacy,
however, the candidacy of other members of MSP3 family is insufficiently
characterized. Here, we investigated Plasmodium falciparum MSP11 (PF3D7_1036000),
a member of the MSP3 family, for its potential as a blood-stage vaccine
candidate. The full-length protein (MSP11-FL) as well as the N-terminal
half-MSP11 (MSP11-N), known to be unique among the MSP3 family members, were
expressed by wheat germ cell-free system, and used to raise antibodies in rabbit.
Immunoblot analysis of schizont lysates probed with anti-MSP11-N antibodies
detected double bands at approximately 40 and 60 kDa, consistent with the
previous report thus confirming antibodies specificity. However, inconsistent
with previously reported merozoite's surface localization, immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) revealed that MSP11 likely localizes to rhoptry neck of merozoites in
mature schizonts. After invasion, MSP11 localized to parasitophorous vacuole and 
thereafter in Maurer's clefts in trophozoites. Anti-MSP11-FL antibody levels were
significantly higher in asymptomatic than symptomatic P. falciparum cases in
malaria low endemic Thailand. This reconfirmed that anti-MSP11 antibodies play an
important role in protection against clinical malaria, as previously reported.
Furthermore, in vitro growth inhibition assay revealed that anti-MSP11-FL rabbit 
antibodies biologically function by inhibiting merozoite invasion of
erythrocytes. These findings further support the vaccine candidacy of MSP11.

Proteins coating Plasmodium merozoite surface and secreted from its apical
organelles are considered as promising vaccine candidates for blood-stage
malaria. The rhoptry neck protein 12 of Plasmodium falciparum (PfRON12) was
recently reported as a protein specifically expressed in schizonts and localized 
to the rhoptry neck of merozoites. Here, we assessed its potential as a vaccine
candidate. We expressed a recombinant PfRON12 protein by a wheat germ cell-free
system to obtain anti-PfRON12 antibody. Immunoblot analysis of schizont lysates
detected a single band at approximately 40 kDa under reducing conditions,
consistent with the predicted molecular weight. Additionally, anti-PfRON12
antibody recognized a single band around 80 kDa under non-reducing conditions,
suggesting native PfRON12 forms a disulfide-bond-mediated multimer.
Immunofluorescence assay and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that PfRON12
localized to the rhoptry neck of merozoites in schizonts and to the surface of
free merozoites. The biological activity of anti-PfRON12 antibody was tested by
in vitro growth inhibition assay (GIA), and the rabbit antibodies significantly
inhibited merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. We then investigated whether
PfRON12 is immunogenic in P. falciparum-infected individuals. The sera from P.
falciparum infected individuals in Thailand and Mali reacted with the recombinant
PfRON12. Furthermore, human anti-PfRON12 antibodies affinity-purified from Malian
serum samples inhibited merozoite invasion of erythrocytes in vitro. Moreover,
pfron12 is highly conserved with only 4 non-synonymous mutations in the coding
sequence from approximately 200 isolates deposited in PlasmoDB. These results
suggest that PfRON12 might be a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen
against P. falciparum.

Malaria continues to be one of the world's most devastating infectious tropical
diseases, and alternative strategies to prevent infection and disease spread are 
urgently needed. These strategies include the development of effective vaccines, 
such as malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) directed against proteins
found on the sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum parasites present in the
mosquito midgut. The Pfs25 protein, which is expressed on the surface of gametes,
zygotes and ookinetes, has been a primary target for TBV development. One such
vaccine strategy based on Pfs25 is a plant-produced malaria vaccine candidate
engineered as a chimeric non-enveloped virus-like particle (VLP) comprising Pfs25
fused to the Alfalfa mosaic virus coat protein. This Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB vaccine
candidate has been engineered and manufactured in Nicotiana benthamiana plants at
pilot plant scale under current Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. The
safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB was assessed in
healthy adult volunteers. This Phase 1, dose escalation, first-in-human study was
designed primarily to evaluate the safety of the purified plant-derived Pfs25 VLP
combined with Alhydrogel® adjuvant. At the doses tested in this Phase 1 study,
the vaccine was generally shown to be safe in healthy volunteers, with no
incidence of vaccine-related serious adverse events and no evidence of any
dose-limiting or dose-related toxicity, demonstrating that the plant-derived
Pfs25 VLP-FhCMB vaccine had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. In
addition, although the vaccine did induce Pfs25-specific IgG in vaccinated
patients in a dose dependent manner, the transmission reducing activity of the
antibodies generated were weak, suggesting the need for an alternative vaccine
adjuvant formulation. This study was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov under

This article contains the peptide data obtained while performing disulfide bond
mapping of the recombinant Plasmodium falciparum protein, Pfs25, produced from
the baculovirus expression system. Pfs25 is a malaria transmission-blocking
vaccine candidate, with a compact and complex structure including 22 cysteines.
This supplementary data is related to the research "Disulfide bond mapping of
Pfs25, a recombinant malaria transmission blocking vaccine candidate" (Lee et
al., 2018) [1]. In brief, Pfs25 was digested with trypsin/Lys-C and derived
peptides separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and analyzed 
by mass spectrometry (MS) by MSE fragmentation. The theoretical peptides and
their respective masses along with disulfide bond locations with linked peptides 
are presented here alongside the mass spectrometry analysis. The raw mass
spectrometry data is made available through the Mass Spectrometry Interactive
Virtual Environment (MassIVE) with identifier: MSV000081982.

Invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites is required in the life cycle of malarial 
parasites. Proteins derived from the invasive merozoites are essential ligands
for erythrocyte recognition and penetration. In this study, we report a novel
protein that possesses a Trx domain-like structure of the thioredoxin family and 
is expressed on the surface of merozoites of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum This protein, namely, PfTrx-mero protein, displayed a mutated sequence
character at the Trx domain, but with a specific binding activity to human
erythrocytes. Specific antibodies to the protein inhibited merozoite invasion
into human erythrocytes. Immunization with a homologous protein of Plasmodium
berghei strain ANKA also showed significant protection against lethal infection
in mice. These results suggested that the novel PfTrx-like-mero protein expressed
on the surface of merozoites is an important ligand participating in erythrocyte 
invasion and a potential vaccine candidate.

Sporozoite-based malaria vaccines have provided a gold standard for malaria
vaccine development, and thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) serves as
the main vaccine candidate antigen on sporozoites. As recombinant malaria vaccine
candidate antigens are poorly immunogenic, additional appropriate
immunostimulants, such as an efficient adjuvant, are highly essential to modulate
Th1-cell predominance and also to induce a protective and long-lived immune
response. In this study, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], the ligand 
of TLR3, was considered as the potential adjuvant for vaccines targeting stronger
Th1-based immune responses. For this purpose, BALB/c mice were immunized with
rPfTRAP delivered in putative poly(I:C) adjuvant, and humoural and cellular
immune responses were determined in different immunized mouse groups. Delivery of
rPfTRAP with poly(I:C) induced high levels and titres of persisted and also
high-avidity anti-rPfTRAP IgG antibodies comparable to complete Freund's adjuvant
(CFA)/incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) adjuvant after the second boost. In
addition, rPfTRAP formulated with poly(I:C) elicited a higher ratio of
IFN-γ/IL-5, IgG2a/IgG1, and IgG2b/IgG1 than with CFA/IFA, indicating that
poly(I:C) supports the induction of a stronger Th1-based immune response. This is
a first time study which reveals the potential of rPfTRAP delivery in poly(I:C)
to increase the level, avidity and durability of both anti-PfTRAP cytophilic
antibodies and Th1 cytokines.

Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) is an abundantly
expressed secreted merozoite surface protein and a leading malaria vaccine
candidate antigen. However, it is unclear how MSP3 is retained on the surface of 
merozoites without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor or a transmembrane
domain. In the present study, we identified an MSP3-associated network on the
Plasmodium merozoite surface by immunoprecipitation of Plasmodium merozoite
lysate using antibody to the N terminus of MSP3 (anti-MSP3N) followed by mass
spectrometry analysis. The results suggested the association of MSP3 with other
merozoite surface proteins: MSP1, MSP6, MSP7, RAP2, and SERA5. Protein-protein
interaction studies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that MSP3 complex consists of MSP1, MSP6,
and MSP7 proteins. Immunological characterization of MSP3 revealed that MSP3N is 
strongly recognized by hyperimmune serum from African and Asian populations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that human antibodies, affinity purified against
recombinant MSP3N (rMSP3N), promote opsonic phagocytosis of merozoites in
cooperation with monocytes. At nonphysiological concentrations, anti-MSP3N
antibodies inhibited the growth of P. falciparum in vitro Together, the data
suggest that MSP3 and especially its N-terminal region containing known B/T cell 
epitopes are targets of naturally acquired immunity against malaria and also
comprise an important candidate for a multisubunit malaria vaccine.

Immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens, such as polysaccharides, can be 
enhanced by conjugation to carriers. Our previous studies indicate that
conjugation to Vi polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi may also enhance
immunogenicity of some protein carriers. We therefore explored the possibility of
generating a bivalent vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and typhoid
fever, which are co-endemic in many parts of the world, by conjugating Vi
polysaccharide, an approved antigen in typhoid vaccine, to Pfs25, a malaria
transmission blocking vaccine antigen in clinical trials. Vi-Pfs25 conjugates
induced strong immune responses against both Vi and Pfs25 in mice, whereas the
unconjugated antigens are poorly immunogenic. Functional assays of immune sera
revealed potent transmission blocking activity mediated by anti-Pfs25 antibody
and serum bactericidal activity due to anti-Vi antibody. Pfs25 conjugation to Vi 
modified the IgG isotype distribution of antisera, inducing a Th2 polarized
immune response against Vi antigen. This conjugate may be further developed as a 
bivalent vaccine to concurrently target malaria and typhoid fever.

Plasmodium infection begins with the bite of an anopheline mosquito, when
sporozoites along with saliva are injected into a vertebrate host. The role of
the host responses to mosquito saliva components in malaria remains unclear. We
observed that antisera against Anopheles gambiae salivary glands partially
protected mice from mosquito-borne Plasmodium infection. Specifically, antibodies
to A. gambiae TRIO (AgTRIO), a mosquito salivary gland antigen, contributed to
the protection. Mice administered AgTRIO antiserum showed lower Plasmodium liver 
burden and decreased parasitemia when exposed to infected mosquitoes. Active
immunization with AgTRIO was also partially protective against Plasmodium berghei
infection. A combination of AgTRIO antiserum and antibodies against Plasmodium
circumsporozoite protein, a vaccine candidate, further decreased P. berghei
infection. In humanized mice, AgTRIO antiserum afforded some protection against
mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium falciparum. AgTRIO antiserum reduced the movement
of sporozoites in the murine dermis. AgTRIO may serve as an arthropod-based
target against Plasmodium to combat malaria.

The lack of preclinical models able to faithfully predict the immune responses
which are later obtained in the clinic is a major hurdle for vaccines development
as it increases markedly the delays and the costs required to perform clinical
studies. We developed and evaluated the relevance to human immune responses of a 
novel humanized mouse model, humanized-spleen cells-NOD-SCID-gamma null
(Hu-SPL-NSG), in which we grafted human spleen cells in immunodeficient
NOD-SCID-IL-2rγnull (NSG) mice. We selected the malaria vaccine candidate, Liver 
Stage Antigen 3-Full Length, because we had previously observed a major
discrepancy between preclinical and clinical results, and compared its
immunogenicity with that of a shorter form of the molecule, LSA3-729. NSG mice
engrafted with human spleen lymphocytes were immunized with either LSA3-FL or
LSA3-729, both adjuvanted with montanide ISA720. We found that the shorter
LSA3-729 triggered the production of human antibodies and a T-helper-type 1
cellular immune response associated with protection whereas LSA3-FL did not.
Results were consistent in five groups receiving lymphocytes from five distinct
human donors. We identified antigenic regions in the full-length molecule, but
not in the shorter version, which induced T-regulatory type of cellular
responses. These regions had failed to be predicted by previous preclinical
experiments in a wide range of animal models, including primates. Results were
reproducible using spleen cells from all five human donors. The findings in the
Hu-SPL-NSG model were similar to the results obtained using LSA3-FL in the clinic
and hence could have been used to predict them. The model does not present graft 
versus host reaction, low survival of engrafted B lymphocytes and difficulty to
raise primary immune responses, all limitations previously reported in humanized 
immune-compromised mice. Results also point to the shorter construct, LSA3-729 as
a more efficient vaccine candidate. In summary, our findings indicate that the
Hu-SPL-NSG model could be a relevant and cost-saving choice for early selection
of vaccine candidates before clinical development, and deserves being further
evaluated.

BACKGROUND: Maternal malaria is a tropical scourge associated with poor pregnancy
outcomes. Women become resistant to Plasmodium falciparum pregnancy malaria as
they acquire antibodies to the variant surface antigen VAR2CSA, a leading vaccine
candidate. Because malaria infection may increase VAR2CSA antibody levels and
thereby confound analyses of immune protection, gravidity-dependent changes in
antibody levels during and after infection, and the effect of VAR2CSA antibodies 
on pregnancy outcomes were evaluated.
METHODS: Pregnant women enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study of mother-infant 
pairs in Ouelessebougou, Mali provided plasma samples at enrollment, gestational 
week 30-32, and delivery. Antibody levels to VAR2CSA domains were measured using 
a multiplex bead-based assay.
RESULTS: Antibody levels to VAR2CSA were higher in multigravidae than
primigravidae. Malaria infection was associated with increased antibody levels to
VAR2CSA domains. In primigravidae but not in secundigravidae or multigravidae,
antibodies levels sharply declined after an infection. A relationship between any
VAR2CSA antibody specificity and protection from adverse pregnancy outcomes was
not detected.
CONCLUSIONS: During malaria infection, primigravidae acquire short-lived
antibodies. The lack of an association between VAR2CSA domain antibody reactivity
and improved pregnancy outcomes suggests that the recombinant proteins may not
present native epitopes targeted by protective antibodies.

Malaria vaccine development has been confronted with various challenges such as
poor immunogenicity of malaria vaccine candidate antigens, which is considered as
the main challenge. However, this problem can be managed using appropriate
formulations of antigens and adjuvants. Poly(I:C) is a potent Th1 inducer and a
human compatible adjuvant capable of stimulating both B- and T-cell immunity.
Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 142 (PfMSP-142) is a promising
vaccine candidate for blood stage of malaria that has faced several difficulties 
in clinical trials, mainly due to improper adjuvants. Therefore, in the current
study, poly(I:C), as a potent Th1 inducer adjuvant, was evaluated to improve the 
immunogenicity of recombinant PfMSP-142, when compared to CFA/IFA, as reference
adjuvant. Poly(I:C) produced high level and titers of anti-PfMSP-142 IgG
antibodies in which was comparable to CFA/IFA adjuvant. In addition, PfMSP-142
formulated with poly(I:C) elicited a higher ratio of IFN-γ/IL-4 (23.9) and
IgG2a/IgG1 (3.77) with more persistent, higher avidity, and titer of IgG2a
relative to CFA/IFA, indicating a potent Th1 immune response. Poly(I:C) could
also help to induce anti-PfMSP-142 antibodies with higher growth-inhibitory
activity than CFA/IFA. Altogether, the results of the current study demonstrated 
that poly(I:C) is a potent adjuvant that can be appropriate for being used in
PfMSP-142-based vaccine formulations.

BACKGROUND: Malaria in pregnancy is a major cause of poor maternal and infant
health, and is associated with the sequestration of P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta. The leading vaccine candidate for pregnancy
malaria, VAR2CSA, has been shown to induce antibodies that inhibit IE adhesion to
the placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), potentially preventing
placental infection. However, the ability of vaccination-induced antibodies to
promote opsonic phagocytosis is not well defined, but likely to be an important
component of protective immunity.
METHODS: We investigated the use of an opsonic phagocytosis assay to evaluate
antibodies induced by pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate antigens based on
VAR2CSA. Opsonic phagocytosis was measured by flow cytometry and visualized by
electron microscopy. We measured vaccine-induced antibody reactivity to placental
type IEs from different geographical origins, and the functional ability of
antibodies raised in immunized rabbits to induce phagocytosis by a human monocyte
cell line.
RESULTS: Immunization-induced antibodies showed a mixture of strain-specific and 
cross-reactive antibody recognition of different placental-binding parasite
lines. Antibodies generated against the DBL5 and DBL3 domains of VAR2CSA
effectively promoted the opsonic phagocytosis of IEs by human monocytes; however,
these functional antibodies were largely allele-specific and not cross-reactive. 
This has significant implications for the development of vaccines aiming to
achieve a broad coverage against diverse parasite strains. Using competition
ELISAs, we found that acquired human antibodies among pregnant women targeted
both cross-reactive and allele-specific epitopes, consistent with what we
observed with vaccine-induced antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccines based on domains of VAR2CSA induced opsonic phagocytosis of
IEs in a strain-specific manner. Assays measuring this phagocytic activity have
the potential to aid the development and evaluation of vaccines against malaria
in pregnancy.

Although it is generally agreed that an effective vaccine would greatly
accelerate the control of malaria, the lone registered malaria vaccine Mosquirix™
has an efficacy of 30%-60% that wanes rapidly, indicating a need for improved
second-generation malaria vaccines. Previous studies suggested that immune
responses to a chimeric Plasmodium falciparum antigen UB05-09 are associated with
immune protection against malaria. Herein, the preclinical efficacy and
immunogenicity of UB05-09 are tested. Growth inhibition assay was employed to
measure the effect of anti-UB05-09 antibodies on P. falciparum growth in vitro.
BALB/c mice were immunized with UB05-09 and challenged with the lethal Plasmodium
yoelii 17XL infection. ELISA was used to measure antigen-specific antibody
production. ELISPOT assays were employed to measure interferon-gamma production
ex vivo after stimulation with chimeric UB05-09 and its constituent antigens.
Purified immunoglobulins raised in rabbits against UB05-09 significantly
inhibited P. falciparum growth in vitro compared to that of its respective
constituent antigens. A combination of antibodies to UB05-09 and the apical
membrane antigen (AMA1) completely inhibited P. falciparum growth in culture.
Immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant UB05-09 blocked parasitaemia and
protected them against lethal P. yoelii 17XL challenge infection. These data
suggest that UB05-09 is a malaria vaccine candidate that could be developed

Malaria is an infectious disease having a large negative impact on economic
growth. Vaccines are considered as a novel strategy to reduce the burden of
malaria. Malaria parasite has a complex life cycle and attempts are being made to
develop vaccines that target each stage of the life cycle. Oral vaccines seem to 
be more feasible to implement in poor countries, since they are relatively
inexpensive, needle-free administrated, mostly stable at non-refrigerated
conditions and painless. By using recombinant technology, suitable oral hosts
could serve as antigen delivering vehicles in developing oral vaccines.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii offers beneficial attributes as oral recombinant
protein expression platform. Moreover, C. reinhardtii chloroplast is an
attractive platform for expressing malaria antigens because it is capable of
folding complex proteins, including those requiring disulfide bond formation,
while lacking the ability to glycosylate proteins; a valuable quality of any
malaria protein expression system, since the Plasmodium parasite lacks N-linked
glycosylation machinery. As a first step towards developing an oral vaccine
candidate against malaria, here, we expressed a fusion protein consisting of
PfCelTOS, a candidate for pre-erythrocytic and transmission-blocking vaccines,
fused to human interleukin-2 (IL-2) as vaccine adjuvant in the chloroplast of C. 
reinhardtii. The effect of light and media on recombinant protein production and 
cell growth was then studied. Results demonstrated that expressed recombinant
proteins accumulate as a soluble, properly folded and functional protein within
algal chloroplasts. Moreover, results showed that the highest cell density can be
achieved using mixotrophy mode. However, protein accumulation appears to be
favored by cultivating in TAP medium in low light.

The target molecules of antibodies against falciparum malaria remain largely
unknown. Recently we have identified multiple proteins as targets of immunity
against Plasmodium falciparum using African serum samples. To investigate whether
potential targets of clinical immunity differ with transmission intensity, we
assessed immune responses in residents of low malaria transmission region in
Thailand. Malaria asymptomatic volunteers (Asy: n=19) and symptomatic patients
(Sym: n=21) were enrolled into the study. Serum immunoreactivity to 186 wheat
germ cell-free system (WGCFS)-synthesized recombinant P. falciparum asexual-blood
stage proteins were determined by AlphaScreen, and subsequently compared between 
the study groups. Forty proteins were determined as immunoreactive with antibody 
responses to 35 proteins being higher in Asy group than in Sym group. Among the
35 proteins, antibodies to MSP3, MSPDBL1, RH2b, and MSP7 were significantly
higher in Asy than Sym (unadjusted p<0.005) suggesting these antigens may have a 
protective role in clinical malaria. MSP3 reactivity remained significantly
different between Asy and Sym groups even after multiple comparison adjustments
(adjusted p=0.033). Interestingly, while our two preceding studies using African 
sera were conducted differently (e.g., cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design,
observed clinical manifestation vs. functional activity), those studies similarly
identified MSP3 and MSPDBL1 as potential targets of protective immunity. This
study further provides a strong rationale for the application of WGCFS-based
immunoprofiling to malaria vaccine candidate and biomarker discovery even in low 
or reduced malaria transmission settings.

A liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method was developed to map the 
eleven disulfide bonds in Pfs25, a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine
candidate. The compact and complex nature of Pfs25 has led to difficulties in
prior peptide mapping efforts. Here, we report confirmation of proper disulfide
pairing of a recombinant Pfs25, by optimizing denaturation and digestion with
trypsin/Lys-C. The digested peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC to
obtain the peptide map and elucidate the disulfide linkages. MSE fragmentation
confirmed the digested peptides and disulfide bonds. The eleven disulfide bonds
and locations matched the predicted Pvs25 crystal structure, a Pfs25 homologue.

BACKGROUND: Studies to assess the immune responses against malaria in Cameroonian
children are limited. The purpose of this study was to assess the immune
responses against Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-119) and
apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) in children residing in the different
epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey performed between April and July 2015, 602
children between 2 and 15 years (mean ± SD = 5.7 ± 3.7), comprising 319 (53%)
males were enrolled from five epidemiological strata of malaria in Cameroon
including: the sudano-sahelian (SS) strata, the high inland plateau (HIP) strata,
the south Cameroonian equatorial forest (SCEF) strata, the high western plateau
(HWP) strata, and the coastal (C) strata. The children were screened for clinical
malaria (defined by malaria parasitaemia ≥ 5000 parasites/µl plus axillary
temperature ≥ 37.5 °C). Their antibody responses were measured against P.
falciparum MSP-119 and AMA-1 vaccine candidate antigens using standard ELISA
technique.
RESULTS: A majority of the participants were IgG responders 72.1% (95% CI
68.3-75.6). The proportion of responders was higher in females (p = 0.002) and in
children aged 10 years and above (p = 0.005). The proportion of responders was
highest in Limbe (C strata) and lowest in Ngaoundere (HIP strata) (p < 0.0001).
Similarly, the mean IgG antibody levels were higher in children aged 10 years and
above (p < 0.0001) and in Limbe (p = 0.001). The IgG antibody levels against
AMA-1 were higher in females (p = 0.028), meanwhile no gender disparity was
observed with MSP-1. Furthermore the risk of clinical malaria (p < 0.0001) and
the mean parasite density (p = 0.035) were higher in IgG non-responders.
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of IgG responders was observed in this study,
suggesting a high degree exposure of the target population to malaria parasites. 
The immune responses varied considerably across the different strata: the highest
levels observed in the C strata and the lowest in the HIP strata. Furthermore,
malaria transmission in Cameroon could be categorized into two major groups based
on the serological reaction of the children: the southern (comprising C and SCEF 
strata) and northern (comprising HWP, HIP and SS strata) groups. These findings
may have significant implications in the design of future trials for evaluating
malaria vaccine candidates in Cameroon.

Rational strategies for obtaining malaria vaccine candidates should include not
only a proper selection of target antigens for antibody stimulation, but also a
versatile molecular design based on ordering the right pieces from the complex
pathogen molecular puzzle towards more active and functional immunogens.
Classical Plasmodium falciparum antigens regarded as vaccine candidates have been
selected as model targets in this study. Among all possibilities we have chosen
epitopes of PfCSP, STARP; MSA1 and Pf155/RESA from pre- and erythrocyte stages
respectively for designing a large 82-residue chimeric immunogen. A number of
options aimed at diminishing steric hindrance for synthetic procedures were
assessed based on standard Fmoc chemistry such as building block orthogonal
ligation; pseudo-proline and microwave-assisted procedures, therefore the
large-chimeric target was produced, characterized and immunologically tested.
Antigenicity and functional in vivo efficacy tests of the large-chimera
formulations administered alone or as antigen mixtures have proven the
stimulation of high antibody titers, showing strong correlation with protection
and parasite clearance of vaccinated BALB/c mice after being lethally challenged 
with both P. berghei-ANKA and P. yoelii 17XL malaria strains. Besides, 3D
structure features shown by the large-chimera encouraged as to propose using
these rational designed large synthetic molecules as reliable vaccine
candidate-presenting systems.

Challenges with the production and suboptimal immunogenicity of malaria vaccine
candidates have slowed the development of a Plasmodium falciparum multiantigen
vaccine. Attempting to resolve these issues, we focused on the use of highly
immunogenic merozoite surface protein 8 (MSP8) as a vaccine carrier protein.
Previously, we showed that a genetic fusion of the C-terminal 19-kDa fragment of 
merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP119) to P. falciparum MSP8 (PfMSP8) facilitated
antigen production and folding and the induction of neutralizing antibodies to
conformational B cell epitopes of MSP119 Here, using the PfMSP1/8 construct, we
further optimized the recombinant PfMSP8 (rPfMSP8) carrier by the introduction of
two cysteine-to-serine substitutions (CΔS) to improve the yield of the monomeric 
product. We then sought to test the broad applicability of this approach using
the transmission-blocking vaccine candidate Pfs25. The production of rPfs25-based
vaccines has presented challenges. Antibodies directed against the four highly
constrained epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains of Pfs25 block
sexual-stage development in mosquitoes. The sequence encoding mature Pfs25 was
codon harmonized for expression in Escherichia coli We produced a rPfs25-PfMSP8
fusion protein [rPfs25/8(CΔS)] as well as unfused, mature rPfs25. rPfs25 was
purified with a modest yield but required the incorporation of refolding
protocols to obtain a proper conformation. In comparison, chimeric rPfs25/8(CΔS) 
was expressed and easily purified, with the Pfs25 domain bearing the proper
conformation without renaturation. Both antigens were immunogenic in rabbits,
inducing IgG that bound native Pfs25 and exhibited potent transmission-reducing
activity. These data further demonstrate the utility of PfMSP8 as a
parasite-specific carrier protein to enhance the production of complex malaria
vaccine targets.

Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) poses a threat to both the mother and fetus,
increasing the risk of severe maternal anemia, fetal growth restriction and low
birth weight infants. Two vaccines are currently in development to protect women 
from Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy. Both vaccine constructs target the
ID1-DBL2X domain of VAR2CSA, a protein expressed on the surface of infected
erythrocytes (IEs) that mediates parasite sequestration in the placenta. Although
development of an effective vaccine may be hampered by ID1-DBL2X polymorphisms
expressed by field isolates, a recent study showed that genetic variation of this
domain in South American parasite populations is much lower than in other
geographical locations. This suggests that a recombinant vaccine designed to be
efficacious in Africa and Asia is likely to be efficacious in South America.
However, these studies did not include Colombian parasite populations in their
analyses, which are known to be genetically distinct from other South American
parasite populations due to their independent introduction from Africa.
Therefore, we sought to determine the genetic variation of the ID1-DBL2X domain
in Colombian parasites to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccine against
PAM in this region. Through sequence analysis and population genetics, we show
that there is a low degree of genetic variation amongst Colombian parasite
populations and that a vaccine containing conserved antigen variants for
worldwide populations is likely to be protective against PAM in Colombia. Our
analysis also points towards an African origin for Colombian parasite
populations, and suggests that their introduction into Colombia was a recurrent
process encompassing multiple introduction events.

Maternal antibodies may play a role in protecting newborns against malaria
disease. Plasmodium falciparum parasite surface antigens are diverse, and
protection from infection requires allele-specific immunity. Although
malaria-specific antibodies have been shown to cross the placenta, the extent to 
which antibodies that respond to the full repertoire of diverse antigens are
transferred from the mother to the infant has not been explored. Understanding
the breadth of maternal antibody responses and to what extent these antibodies
are transferred to the child can inform vaccine design and evaluation. We probed 
plasma from cord blood and serum from mothers at delivery using a customized
protein microarray that included variants of malaria vaccine target antigens to
assess the intensity and breadth of seroreactivity to three malaria vaccine
candidate antigens in mother-newborn pairs in Malawi. Among the 33 paired
specimens that were assessed, mothers and newborns had similar intensity and
repertoire of seroreactivity. Maternal antibody levels against vaccine candidate 
antigens were the strongest predictors of infant antibody levels. Placental
malaria did not significantly impair transplacental antibody transfer. However,
mothers with placental malaria had significantly higher antibody levels against
these blood-stage antigens than mothers without placental malaria. The repertoire
and levels of infant antibodies against a wide range of malaria vaccine candidate
antigen variants closely mirror maternal levels in breadth and magnitude
regardless of evidence of placental malaria. Vaccinating mothers with an
effective malaria vaccine during pregnancy may induce high and potentially
protective antibody repertoires in newborns.

BACKGROUND: VAR2CSA, a member of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (PfEMP1) family, mediates the binding of P. falciparum-infected
erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate A, a surface-associated molecule expressed in
placental cells, and plays a central role in the pathogenesis of placental
malaria. VAR2CSA is a target of naturally acquired immunity and, as such, is a
leading vaccine candidate against placental malaria. This protein is very
polymorphic and technically challenging to sequence. Published var2csa sequences,
mostly limited to specific domains, have been generated through the sequencing of
cloned PCR amplicons using capillary electrophoresis, a method that is both time 
consuming and costly, and that performs poorly when applied to clinical samples
that are commonly polyclonal. A next-generation sequencing platform, Pacific
Biosciences (PacBio), offers an alternative approach to overcome these issues.
METHODS: PCR primers were designed that target a 5 kb segment in the 5' end of
var2csa and the resulting amplicons were sequenced using PacBio sequencing. The
primers were optimized using two laboratory strains and were validated on DNA
from 43 clinical samples, extracted from dried blood spots on filter paper or
from cryopreserved P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Sequence reads were
assembled using the SMRT-analysis ConsensusTools module.
RESULTS: Here, a PacBio sequencing-based approach for recovering a segment
encoding the majority of VAR2CSA's extracellular region is described; this
segment includes the totality of the first four domains in the 5' end of var2csa 
(~5 kb), from clinical malaria samples. The feasibility of the method is
demonstrated, showing a high success rate from cryopreserved samples and more
limited success from dried blood spots stored at room temperature, and
characterized the genetic variation of the var2csa locus.
CONCLUSIONS: This method will facilitate a detailed analysis of var2csa genetic
variation and can be adapted to sequence other hypervariable P. falciparum genes.

Transmission-blocking vaccines have the potential to accelerate malaria parasite 
elimination by inducing antibodies that block parasite transmission from humans
to mosquitoes. Pfs230, a gametocyte surface protein involved in gamete function, 
has long been a promising candidate. Due to the large size (3,135 amino acids),
complex domains, and repeating 6-cysteine (6-Cys) motifs with a multitude of
disulfide bonds, the feasibility of expression of a full-length protein has been 
difficult. A priority focus, therefore, has been on the generation of single
domains, including N-terminal fragments. Here we utilized a heterologous
expression system, baculovirus, to produce an N-terminal domain of Pfs230
(Pfs230C1). Pfs230C1 (amino acids 443 to 731) with a polyhistidine affinity tag
was expressed in Super Sf9 cells. Since the native host lacks glycosylation
machinery, a single N585Q mutation was made to eliminate potential N-linked
glycosylation. The expressed protein, purified by nickel affinity, ion exchange, 
and size exclusion chromatography to >90% purity, was present in monomeric form
with an observed mass of 33,510 Da (matching oxidized form). Peptide mapping and 
disulfide analysis confirmed the proper formation of predicted disulfide bonds.
Antibodies, generated against Pfs230C1 in mice, bound to the gametocyte in an
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and demonstrated functional activity in both the
standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) and the exflagellation assay (EXA). The
biochemical, biophysical, and immunological results reported herein support the
continued advancement of an N-terminal Pfs230 antigen (Pfs230C1) as a component
of a transmission-blocking vaccine. Our results also support the continued use of
the scalable baculovirus expression system for the generation of complex
Plasmodium proteins.

PURPOSE: Production and characterization of a chimeric fusion protein (GMZ2'.10C)
which combines epitopes of key malaria parasite antigens: glutamate-rich protein 
(GLURP), merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3), and the highly disulphide bonded
Pfs48/45 (10C). GMZ2'.10C is a potential candidate for a multi-stage malaria
vaccine that targets both transmission and asexual life-cycle stages of the
parasite.
METHODS: GMZ2'.10C was produced in Lactococcus lactis and purified using either
an immunoaffinity purification (IP) or a conventional purification (CP) method.
Protein purity and stability was analysed by RP-HPLC, SEC-HPLC, 2-site ELISA,
gel-electrophoresis and Western blotting. Structural characterization (mass
analysis, peptide mapping and cysteine connectivity mapping) was performed by
LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: CP-GMZ2'.10C resulted in similar purity, yield, structure and stability 
as compared to IP-GMZ2'.10C. CP-GMZ2'.10C and IP-GMZ2'.10C both elicited a high
titer of transmission blocking (TB) antibodies in rodents. The intricate
disulphide-bond connectivity of C-terminus Pfs48/45 was analysed by tandem mass
spectrometry and was established for GMZ2'.10C and two reference fusion proteins 
encompassing similar parts of Pfs48/45.
CONCLUSION: GMZ2'.10C, combining GMZ2' and correctly-folded Pfs48/45 can be
produced by the Lactoccus lactis P170 based expression system in purity and
quality for pharmaceutical development and elicit high level of TB antibodies.
The cysteine connectivity for the 10C region of Pfs48/45 was revealed
experimentally, providing an important guideline for employing the Pfs48/45
antigen in vaccine design.

INTRODUCTION: An efficacious malaria vaccine is necessary to advance the current 
control measures towards malaria elimination. To-date, only RTS,S/AS01, a leading
pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine completed phase 3 trials, but with an efficacy of 
28-36% in children, and 18-26% in infants, that waned over time. Blood-stage
malaria vaccines protect against disease, and are considered effective targets
for the logical design of next generation vaccines to improve the RTS,S field
efficacy. Therefore, novel blood-stage vaccine candidate discovery efforts are
critical, albeit with several challenges including, high polymorphisms in vaccine
antigens, poor understanding of targets of naturally protective immunity, and
difficulties in the expression of high AT-rich plasmodial proteins. Areas
covered: PubMed ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ) was searched to review the
progress and future prospects of malaria vaccine research and development. We
focused on post-genome vaccine candidate discovery, malaria vaccine development, 
sequence diversity, pre-clinical and clinical trials. Expert commentary:
Post-genome high-throughput technologies using wheat germ cell-free protein
synthesis technology and immuno-profiling with sera from malaria patients with
clearly defined outcomes are highlighted to overcome current challenges of
malaria vaccine candidate discovery.

Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum continues to threaten millions of people 
living in the tropical parts of the world. A vaccine that confers sterile and
life-long protection remains elusive despite more than 30years of effort and
resources invested in solving this problem. Antibodies to a malaria vaccine
candidate circumsporozoite protein (CSP) can block invasion and can protect
humans against malaria. We have manufactured the Falciparum Malaria Protein-013
(FMP013) vaccine based on the nearly full-length P. falciparum CSP 3D7 strain
sequence. We report here immunogenicity and challenge data on FMP013 antigen in
C57BL/6 mice formulated with two novel adjuvants of the Army Liposome Formulation
(ALF) series and a commercially available adjuvant Montanide ISA 720 (Montanide) 
as a control. ALF is a liposomal adjuvant containing a synthetic monophosphoryl
lipid A (3D-PHAD®). In our study, FMP013 was adjuvanted with ALF alone, ALF
containing aluminum hydroxide (ALFA) or ALF containing QS-21 (ALFQ). Adjuvants
ALF and ALFA induced similar antibody titers and protection against transgenic
parasite challenge that were comparable to Montanide. ALFQ was superior to the
other three adjuvants as it induced higher antibody titers with improved boosting
after the third immunization, higher serum IgG2c titers, and enhanced protection.
FMP013+ALFQ also augmented the numbers of splenic germinal center-derived
activated B-cells and antibody secreting cells compared to Montanide. Further,
FMP013+ALFQ induced antigen-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT activity, CD4+ T-cells and a
TH1-biased cytokine profile. These results demonstrate that soluble CSP can
induce a potent and sterile protective immune response when formulated with the
QS-21 containing adjuvant ALFQ. Comparative mouse immunogenicity data presented
here were used as the progression criteria for an ongoing non-human primate study
and a regulatory toxicology study in preparation for a controlled human malaria
infection (CHMI) trial.

PURPOSE: The present study investigated the immunogenic potential of different
cationic liposome formulations with a DNA plasmid encoding Pfs25, a malaria
transmission-blocking vaccine candidate.
METHODS: Pfs25 plasmid DNA was complexed with cationic liposomes to produce
lipoplexes at different charge ratios of the cationic lipid head group to the
nucleotide phosphate (N:P). The formation of lipoplexes was visualized by
Cryogenic-TEM. Confocal microscopy of lipoplexes formed with GFP encoding plasmid
DNA, and flow cytometry was used to determine their in vitro transfection
capability. Two different lipoplex formulations using plasmid DNA encoding Pfs25 
were evaluated for in vivo immunogenicity after intramuscular administration in
Balb/c mice. Immune sera were analyzed by ELISA.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the cationic liposome-mediated DNA
immunization with an N:P charge ratio of 1:3 (anionic lipoplexes) is more
effective than the use of naked plasmid DNA alone. No antibody response was
observed when lipoplexes with a higher N:P charge ratio of 10:3 (cationic
lipoplexes) were used. Trehalose was added to some lipoplex formulations as a
cryoprotectant and adjuvant, but it did not yield any further improvement of
immunogenicity in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that Pfs25 plasmid DNA delivered as lipoplexes
at a charge ratio of 1:3 elicited strong immunogenicity in mice and may be
improved further to match the immune responses of DNA vaccines administered by in
vivo electroporation.

BACKGROUND: The antigen VAR2CSA plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of
pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) caused by Plasmodium falciparum. A
VAR2CSA-based vaccine candidate, PAMVAC, is under development by an EU-funded
multi-country consortium (PlacMalVac project). As part of PAMVAC's clinical
development, we quantified naturally acquired vaccine antigen-specific memory B
and T cell responses in Beninese primigravidae recruited at the beginning of
pregnancy and followed up to delivery and beyond.
METHODS: Clinical and parasitological histories were compiled from monthly clinic
visits. On 4 occasions (first and fifth month of pregnancy, delivery, 6months
post-delivery) peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated for in vitro
assays. PAMVAC-specific memory B cells as well as those specific for a PAM
unrelated P. falciparum antigen (PfEMP1-CIDR1a) and for tetanus toxoid were
quantified by ELISpot. Memory T cell responses were assessed by quantifying
cytokines (IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-γ, TNF-α) in supernatants of cells
stimulated in vitro either with PAMVAC, or mitogen (PHA).
RESULTS: Both tetanus toxoid- and PAMVAC-specific memory B cell frequencies
increased to reach peak levels in the 5th month and at delivery, respectively and
persisted post-delivery. The frequency of CIDR1a-specific memory B cells was
stable during pregnancy, but declined post-delivery. The cumulated prevalence of 
infection with P. falciparum during pregnancy was 61% by microscopy. In women
with a history of such infections, a significantly higher frequency of
PAMVAC-specific memory B cells was observed at delivery. PAMVAC-specific
pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, TNF) responses tended to be higher at delivery in those 
with a history of infection. Mitogen-induced IL-5/IL-13 responses were
significantly enhanced in the same women.
CONCLUSIONS: PAMVAC-specific memory B cells are induced during first pregnancies 
and are maintained post-delivery. Women with a T helper cell profile biased
towards production of Th2-type cytokines have a greater risk of infection with P.
falciparum.

INTRODUCTION: Transgenic malaria parasites expressing foreign genes, for example 
fluorescent and luminescent proteins, are used extensively to interrogate
parasite biology and host-parasite interactions associated with malaria
pathology. Increasingly transgenic parasites are also exploited to advance
malaria vaccine development. Areas covered: We review how transgenic malaria
parasites are used, in vitro and in vivo, to determine protective efficacy of
different antigens and vaccination strategies and to determine immunological
correlates of protection. We describe how chimeric rodent parasites expressing P.
falciparum or P. vivax antigens are being used to directly evaluate and rank
order human malaria vaccines before their advancement to clinical testing. In
addition, we describe how transgenic human and rodent parasites are used to
develop and evaluate live (genetically) attenuated vaccines. Expert commentary:
Transgenic rodent and human malaria parasites are being used to both identify
vaccine candidate antigens and to evaluate both sub-unit and whole organism
vaccines before they are advanced into clinical testing. Transgenic parasites
combined with in vivo pre-clinical testing models (e.g. mice) are used to
evaluate vaccine safety, potency and the durability of protection as well as to
uncover critical protective immune responses and to refine vaccination
strategies.

Pfs25, a Plasmodium falciparum surface protein expressed during zygote and
ookinete stages in infected mosquitoes, is a lead transmission-blocking vaccine
candidate against falciparum malaria. To enhance immunogenicity, recombinant
Pfs25 was chemically conjugated to recombinant nontoxic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
ExoProtein A (rEPA) in conformance with current good manufacturing practices
(cGMP), and formulated with the alum adjuvant Alhydrogel. In order to meet the
regulatory requirements for a phase 1 human clinical trial, the vaccine product
was extensively evaluated for stability at an initial time point and through the 
clinical trial period annually. Because basic quality control methods to
characterize alum-based vaccines remain unavailable, a thermal forced degradation
study was performed prior to the initial evaluation to identify the methods
suitable to detect the quality of vaccine formulations. Our results show that the
vaccine product Pfs25-EPA formulated on Alhydrogel is in conformance with
regulatory guidelines and suitable for human trials.

Naturally acquired antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum schizont egress antigen 1 
(PfSEA-1A) are associated with protection against severe malaria in children.
Vaccination of mice with SEA-1A from Plasmodium berghei (PbSEA-1A) decreases
parasitemia and prolongs survival following P. berghei ANKA challenge. To enhance
the immunogenicity of PfSEA-1A, we identified five linear B-cell epitopes using
peptide microarrays probed with antisera from nonhuman primates vaccinated with
recombinant PfSEA-1A (rPfSEA-1A). We evaluated the relationship between
epitope-specific antibody levels and protection from parasitemia in a
longitudinal treatment-reinfection cohort in western Kenya. Antibodies to three
epitopes were associated with 16 to 17% decreased parasitemia over an 18-week
high transmission season. We are currently designing immunogens to enhance
antibody responses to these three epitopes.

BACKGROUND: Transmission of malaria from man to mosquito depends on the presence 
of gametocytes, the sexual stage of Plasmodium parasites in the infected host.
Naturally acquired antibodies against gametocytes exist and may play a role in
controlling transmission by limiting the gametocyte development in the
circulation or by interrupting gamete development and fertilization in the
mosquito following ingestion. So far, most studies on antibody responses to
sexual stage antigens have focused on a subset of gametocyte-surface antigens,
even though inhibitory Ab responses to other gametocyte antigens might also play 
a role in controlling gametocyte density and fertility. Limited information is
available on natural antibody response to the surfaces of gametocyte-infected
erythrocytes.
METHODS: Ab responses to surface antigens of erythrocytes infected by in vitro
differentiated Plasmodium falciparum mature gametocytes were investigated in sera
of semi-immune adults and malaria-exposed children. In addition, the effect of
immunization with GMZ2, a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate, and the effect
of intestinal helminth infection on the development of immunity to gametocytes of
P. falciparum was evaluated in malaria-exposed children and adults from Gabon.
Serum samples from two Phase I clinical trials conducted in Gabon were analysed
by microscopic and flow-cytometric immunofluorescence assay.
RESULTS: Adults had a higher Ab response compared to children. Ab reactivity was 
significantly higher after fixation and permeabilization of parasitized
erythrocytes. Following vaccination with the malaria vaccine candidate GMZ2,
anti-gametocyte Ab concentration decreased in adults compared to baseline. Ab
response to whole asexual stage antigens had a significant but weak positive
correlation to anti-gametocyte Ab responses in adults, but not in children.
Children infected with Ascaris lumbricoides had a significantly higher
anti-gametocyte Ab response compared to non-infected children.
CONCLUSION: The current data suggest that antigens exposed on the
gametocyte-infected red blood cells are recognized by serum antibodies from
malaria-exposed children and semi-immune adults. This anti-gametocyte immune
response may be influenced by natural exposure and vaccination. Modulation of the
natural immune response to gametocytes by co-infecting parasites should be
investigated further and may have an important impact on malaria control
strategies.

BACKGROUND: Non-human primates, such as the rhesus macaques, are the preferred
model for down-selecting human malaria vaccine formulations, but the rhesus model
is expensive and does not allow for direct efficacy testing of human malaria
vaccines. Transgenic rodent parasites expressing genes of human Plasmodium are
now routinely used for efficacy studies of human malaria vaccines. Mice have
however rarely predicted success in human malaria trials and there is scepticism 
whether mouse studies alone are sufficient to move a vaccine candidate into the
clinic.
METHODS: A comparison of immunogenicity, fine-specificity and functional activity
of two Alum-adjuvanted Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-based
vaccines was conducted in mouse and rhesus models. One vaccine was a soluble
recombinant protein (CSP) and the other was the same CSP covalently conjugated to
the Qβ phage particle (Qβ-CSP).
RESULTS: Mice showed different kinetics of antibody responses and different
sensitivity to the NANP-repeat and N-terminal epitopes as compared to rhesus.
While mice failed to discern differences between the protective efficacy of CSP
versus Qβ-CSP vaccine following direct challenge with transgenic Plasmodium
berghei parasites, rhesus serum from the Qβ-CSP-vaccinated animals induced higher
in vivo sporozoite neutralization activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite some immunologic parallels between models, these data
demonstrate that differences between the immune responses induced in the two
models risk conflicting decisions regarding potential vaccine utility in humans. 
In combination with historical observations, the data presented here suggest that
although murine models may be useful for some purposes, non-human primate models 
may be more likely to predict the human response to investigational vaccines.

We have developed FMP014, a vaccine candidate against Plasmodium falciparum
malaria, which is comprised of 60 identical monomer protein chains that form an
icosahedral shaped self-assembling protein nanoparticle (SAPN). Each monomer
contains selected P. falciparum Circumsporozoite Protein (PfCSP) CD4+ and CD8+
epitopes, universal TH epitopes, portions of the α-TSR domain, and 6 repeats of
the NANP motifs of the PfCSP. Here we describe the conditions that are required
for successful scale-up and cGMP manufacturing of FMP014 with a yield of ≈1.5g of
drug substance per 100g of wet bacterial paste. When adjuvanted with an Army
Liposomal Formulation (ALF) based adjuvant, the nanoparticle vaccine is highly
immunogenic and prevents infection of mice by an otherwise lethal dose of
transgenic P. berghei sporozoites expressing the full-length PfCSP.

Although vaccines would be the ideal tool for control, prevention, elimination,
and eradication of many infectious diseases, developing of parasites vaccines
such as malaria vaccine is very complex. The most advanced malaria vaccine
candidate RTS,S, a pre-erythrocytic vaccine, has been recommended for licensure
by EMEA. The results of this phase III trial suggest that this candidate malaria 
vaccine has relatively little efficacy, and the vaccine apparently will not meet 
the goal of malaria eradication by itself. Since there are many vaccine
candidates in the pipeline 1 that are being evaluated in vaccine trials, further 
study on using of alternative parasite targets and vaccination strategies are
highly recommended.

The cell-traversal protein for ookinetes and sporozoites (CelTOS), a highly
conserved antigen involved in sporozoite motility, plays an important role in the
traversal of host cells during the preerythrocytic stage of Plasmodium species.
Recently, it has been considered an alternative target when designing novel
antimalarial vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum. However, the potential of
Plasmodium vivax CelTOS as a vaccine target is yet to be explored. This study
evaluated the naturally acquired immune response against a recombinant P. vivax
CelTOS (PvCelTOS) (IgG and IgG subclass) in 528 individuals from Brazilian
Amazon, as well as the screening of B-cell epitopes in silico and peptide assays 
to associate the breadth of antibody responses of those individuals with
exposition and/or protection correlates. We show that PvCelTOS is naturally
immunogenic in Amazon inhabitants with 94 individuals (17.8%) showing specific
IgG antibodies against the recombinant protein. Among responders, the IgG
reactivity indexes (RIs) presented a direct correlation with the number of
previous malaria episodes (p = 0.003; r = 0.315) and inverse correlation with the
time elapsed from the last malaria episode (p = 0.031; r = -0.258).
Interestingly, high responders to PvCelTOS (RI > 2) presented higher number of
previous malaria episodes, frequency of recent malaria episodes, and ratio of
cytophilic/non-cytophilic antibodies than low responders (RI < 2) and
non-responders (RI < 1). Moreover, a high prevalence of the cytophilic antibody
IgG1 over all other IgG subclasses (p < 0.0001) was observed. B-cell epitope
mapping revealed five immunogenic regions in PvCelTOS, but no associations
between the specific IgG response to peptides and exposure/protection parameters 
were found. However, the epitope (PvCelTOSI136-E143) was validated as a main
linear B-cell epitope, as 92% of IgG responders to PvCelTOS were also responders 
to this peptide sequence. This study describes for the first time the natural
immunogenicity of PvCelTOS in Amazon individuals and identifies immunogenic
regions in a full-length protein. The IgG magnitude was mainly composed of
cytophilic antibodies (IgG1) and associated with recent malaria episodes. The
data presented in this paper add further evidence to consider PvCelTOS as a
vaccine candidate.

Invasion of erythrocytes by Plasmodial merozoites is a composite process
involving the interplay of several proteins. Among them, the Plasmodium
falciparum Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a
ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH5)
and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion.
Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the
antigen-binding fragment of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts
a 6-bladed β-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold,
but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function.
Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may
facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective
epitopes. Both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed
more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own,
supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in vaccines.

RTS,S is an advanced malaria vaccine candidate and confers significant protection
against Plasmodium falciparum infection in humans. Little is known about the
molecular mechanisms driving vaccine immunity. Here, we applied a systems biology
approach to study immune responses in subjects receiving three consecutive
immunizations with RTS,S (RRR), or in those receiving two immunizations of
RTS,S/AS01 following a primary immunization with adenovirus 35 (Ad35) (ARR)
vector expressing circumsporozoite protein. Subsequent controlled human malaria
challenge (CHMI) of the vaccinees with Plasmodium-infected mosquitoes, 3 wk after
the final immunization, resulted in ∼50% protection in both groups of vaccinees. 
Circumsporozoite protein (CSP)-specific antibody titers, prechallenge, were
associated with protection in the RRR group. In contrast, ARR-induced lower
antibody responses, and protection was associated with polyfunctional CD4+ T-cell
responses 2 wk after priming with Ad35. Molecular signatures of B and plasma
cells detected in PBMCs were highly correlated with antibody titers prechallenge 
and protection in the RRR cohort. In contrast, early signatures of innate
immunity and dendritic cell activation were highly associated with protection in 
the ARR cohort. For both vaccine regimens, natural killer (NK) cell signatures
negatively correlated with and predicted protection. These results suggest that
protective immunity against P. falciparum can be achieved via multiple mechanisms
and highlight the utility of systems approaches in defining molecular correlates 
of protection to vaccination.

Merozoite surface protein 2 (MSP2) is an intrinsically disordered antigen that is
abundant on the surface of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The two
allelic families of MSP2, 3D7 and FC27, differ in their central variable regions,
which are flanked by highly conserved C-terminal and N-terminal regions. In a
vaccine trial, full-length 3D7 MSP2 induced a strain-specific protective immune
response despite the detectable presence of conserved region antibodies. This
work focuses on the conserved C-terminal region of MSP2, which includes the only 
disulphide bond in the protein and encompasses key epitopes recognised by the
mouse monoclonal antibodies 4D11 and 9H4. Although the 4D11 and 9H4 epitopes are 
overlapping, immunofluorescence assays have shown that the mouse monoclonal
antibody 4D11 binds to MSP2 on the merozoite surface with a much stronger signal 
than 9H4. Understanding the structural basis for this antigenic difference
between these antibodies will help direct the design of a broad-spectrum and
MSP2-based malaria vaccine. 4D11 and 9H4 were reengineered into antibody
fragments [variable region fragment (Fv) and single-chain Fv (scFv)] and were
validated as suitable models for their full-sized IgG counterparts by surface
plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry. An alanine scan of the
13-residue epitope 3D7-MSP2207-222 identified the minimal binding epitope of 4D11
and the key residues involved in binding. A 2.2-Å crystal structure of 4D11 Fv
bound to the eight-residue epitope NKENCGAA provided valuable insight into the
possible conformation of the C-terminal region of MSP2 on the parasite. This work
underpins continued efforts to optimise recombinant MSP2 constructs for
evaluation as potential vaccine candidates.

BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination campaigns are planned or active in many
countries. The effects of malaria elimination on immune responses such as
antigen-specific IFN- γ responses are not well characterized.
METHODS: IFN- γ responses to the P. falciparum antigens circumsporozoite protein,
liver stage antigen-1, thrombospondin-related adhesive protein, apical membrane
antigen-1, MB2, and merozoite surface protein-1 were tested by ELISA in 243
individuals in highland Kenya in April 2008, October 2008, and April 2009, after 
a one-year period of interrupted malaria transmission from April 2007 to March
2008.
RESULTS: While one individual (0.4%) tested positive for P. falciparum by PCR
inOctober 2008 and another two (0.9%) tested positive in April 2009, no clinical 
malaria cases were detected during weekly visits. Levels of IFN-γ to all antigens
decreased significantly from April 2008 to April 2009 (all P < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: Naturally acquired IFN- γ responses to P. falciparum antigensare
short-lived in the absence of repeated P. falciparum infection. Even short
periods of malaria interruption may significantly decrease IFN-γ responses to P. 
falciparum antigens.

Many promising vaccine candidates from pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and
parasites are unstable and cannot be produced cheaply for clinical use. For
instance, Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homolog 5 (PfRH5) is
essential for erythrocyte invasion, is highly conserved among field isolates, and
elicits antibodies that neutralize in vitro and protect in an animal model,
making it a leading malaria vaccine candidate. However, functional RH5 is only
expressible in eukaryotic systems and exhibits moderate temperature tolerance,
limiting its usefulness in hot and low-income countries where malaria prevails.
Current approaches to immunogen stabilization involve iterative application of
rational or semirational design, random mutagenesis, and biochemical
characterization. Typically, each round of optimization yields minor improvement 
in stability, and multiple rounds are required. In contrast, we developed a
one-step design strategy using phylogenetic analysis and Rosetta atomistic
calculations to design PfRH5 variants with improved packing and surface polarity.
To demonstrate the robustness of this approach, we tested three PfRH5 designs,
all of which showed improved stability relative to wild type. The best, bearing
18 mutations relative to PfRH5, expressed in a folded form in bacteria at >1 mg
of protein per L of culture, and had 10-15 °C higher thermal tolerance than wild 
type, while also retaining ligand binding and immunogenic properties
indistinguishable from wild type, proving its value as an immunogen for a future 
generation of vaccines against the malaria blood stage. We envision that this
efficient computational stability design methodology will also be used to enhance
the biophysical properties of other recalcitrant vaccine candidates from emerging
pathogens.

The most effective vaccine candidate of malaria is based on the Plasmodium
falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), a major surface protein implicated in 
the structural strength, motility, and immune evasion properties of the infective
sporozoites. It is suspected that reversible conformational changes of CSP are
required for infection of the mammalian host, but the detailed structure and
dynamic properties of CSP remain incompletely understood, limiting our
understanding of its function in the infection. Here, we report the structural
and mechanical properties of the CSP studied using single-molecule force
spectroscopy on several constructs, one including the central region of CSP,
which is rich in NANP amino acid repeats (CSPrep), and a second consisting of a
near full-length sequence without the signal and anchor hydrophobic domains
(CSPΔHP). Our results show that the CSPrep is heterogeneous, with 40% of
molecules requiring virtually no mechanical force to unfold (<10 piconewtons
(pN)), suggesting that these molecules are mechanically compliant and perhaps act
as entropic springs, whereas the remaining 60% are partially structured with low 
mechanical resistance (∼70 pN). CSPΔHP having multiple force peaks suggests
specifically folded domains, with two major populations possibly indicating the
open and collapsed forms. Our findings suggest that the overall low mechanical
resistance of the repeat region, exposed on the outer surface of the sporozoites,
combined with the flexible full-length conformations of CSP, may provide the
sporozoites not only with immune evasion properties, but also with lubricating
capacity required during its navigation through the mosquito and vertebrate host 
tissues. We anticipate that these findings would further assist in the design and

Efforts are under way to improve the efficacy of subunit malaria vaccines through
assessments of new adjuvants, vaccination platforms, and antigens. In this study,
we further assessed the Plasmodium falciparum antigen upregulated in infective
sporozoites 3 (PfUIS3) as a vaccine candidate. PfUIS3 was expressed in the viral 
vectors chimpanzee adenovirus 63 (ChAd63) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara
(MVA) and used to immunize mice in a prime-boost regimen. We previously
demonstrated that this regimen could provide partial protection against challenge
with chimeric P. berghei parasites expressing PfUIS3. We now show that ChAd63-MVA
PfUIS3 can also provide partial cross-species protection against challenge with
wild-type P. berghei parasites. We also show that PfUIS3-specific cellular memory
responses could be recalled in human volunteers exposed to P. falciparum
parasites in a controlled human malaria infection study. When ChAd63-MVA PfUIS3
was coadministered with the vaccine candidate P. falciparum
thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (PfTRAP) expressed in the ChAd63-MVA
system, there was no significant change in immunogenicity to either vaccine.
However, when mice were challenged with double chimeric P. berghei-P. falciparum 
parasites expressing both PfUIS3 and PfTRAP, vaccine efficacy was improved to
100% sterile protection. This synergistic effect was evident only when the two
vaccines were mixed and administered at the same site. We have therefore
demonstrated that vaccination with PfUIS3 can induce a consistent delay in patent
parasitemia across mouse strains and against chimeric parasites expressing PfUIS3
as well as wild-type P. berghei; when this vaccine is combined with another
partially protective regimen (ChAd63-MVA PfTRAP), complete protection is induced.

BACKGROUND: The malaria vaccine candidate RTS,S/AS01 (GSK Vaccines) induces high 
IgG concentration against the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium
falciparum. In human vaccine recipients circulating anti-CSP antibody
concentrations are associated with protection against infection but appear not to
be the correlate of protection. However, in a humanized mouse model of malaria
infection prophylactic administration of a human monoclonal antibody (MAL1C),
derived from a RTS,S/AS01-immunized volunteer, directed against the CSP repeat
region, conveyed full protection in a dose-dependent manner suggesting that
antibodies alone are able to prevent P. falciparum infection when present in
sufficiently high concentrations. A competition ELISA was developed to measure
the presence of MAL1C-like antibodies in polyclonal sera from RTS,S/AS01 vaccine 
recipients and study their possible contribution to protection against infection.
RESULTS: MAL1C-like antibodies present in polyclonal vaccine-induced sera were
evaluated for their ability to compete with biotinylated monoclonal antibody
MAL1C for binding sites on the capture antigen consisting of the recombinant
protein encompassing 32 NANP repeats of CSP (R32LR). Serum samples were taken at 
different time points from participants in two RTS,S/AS01 vaccine studies
(NCT01366534 and NCT01857869). Vaccine-induced protection status of the study
participants was determined based on the outcome of experimental challenge with
infected mosquito bites after vaccination. Optimal conditions were established to
reliably detect MAL1C-like antibodies in polyclonal sera. Polyclonal anti-CSP
antibodies and MAL1C-like antibody content were measured in 276 serum samples
from RTS,S/AS01 vaccine recipients using the standard ELISA and MAL-1C
competition ELISA, respectively. A strong correlation was observed between the
results from these assays. However, no correlation was found between the results 
of either assay and protection against infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The competition ELISA to measure MAL1C-like antibodies in polyclonal
sera from RTS,S/AS01 vaccine recipients was robust and reliable but did not
reveal the elusive correlate of protection.

Shifting the malaria priorities from a paradigm of control and elimination to a
goal of global eradication calls for renewed attention to the interruption of
malaria transmission. Sustained progress toward eradication will require both
improved understanding of infectious reservoirs and efficient development of
novel transmission-blocking interventions, such as rapidly acting and highly
efficacious therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we review the direct skin feeding
assay (DSF), which has been proposed as a valuable tool for measuring the in
natura transmission of malaria parasites from human hosts to mosquito vectors
across heterogeneous populations. To capture the methodological breadth of this
assay's use, we first systematically review and qualitatively synthesize
previously published investigations using DSFs to study malaria transmission in
humans. Then, using a recent Phase 1 trial in Mali of the Pfs25H-EPA/Alhydrogel® 
vaccine candidate (NCT01867463) designed to interrupt Plasmodium falciparum
transmission as a case study, we describe the potential opportunities and current
limitations of utilizing the endpoints measured by DSF in making early clinical
decisions for individually randomized transmission-interrupting intervention
candidates. Using simulations based on the data collected in the clinical trial, 
we demonstrate that the capacity of the DSF to serve as an evaluative tool is
limited by the statistical power constraints of the "effective sample size" (i.e.
the number of subjects that are capable of transmitting at the time of feeding). 
Altogether, our findings suggest DSFs have great potential utility for assessing 
the public health impacts of emerging antimalarial tools, but additional research
is needed to address issues of scalability and to establish correlation with
community-wide clinical endpoints as well as complementary in vitro measures,
such as standard membrane feeding assays.

Genetic variability in Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites hampers current
malaria vaccine development efforts. Here, we hypothesize that to address the
impact of genetic variability on vaccine efficacy in clinical trials, conserved
antigen targets should be selected to achieve robust host immunity across
multiple falciparum strains. Therefore, suitable vaccine antigens should be
assessed for levels of polymorphism and genetic diversity. Using a total of one
hundred and two clinical isolates from a region of high malaria transmission in
Uganda, we analyzed extent of polymorphism and genetic diversity in four recently
reported novel blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate proteins: Rh5 interacting
protein (PfRipr), GPI anchored micronemal antigen (PfGAMA), rhoptry-associated
leucine zipper-like protein 1 (PfRALP1) and Duffy binding-like merozoite surface 
protein 1 (PfMSPDBL1). In addition, utilizing the wheat germ cell-free system, we
expressed recombinant proteins for the four candidates based on P. falciparum
laboratory strain 3D7 sequences, immunized rabbits to obtain specific antibodies 
(Abs) and performed functional growth inhibition assay (GIA). The GIA activity of
the raised Abs was demonstrated using both homologous 3D7 and heterologous FVO
strains in vitro. Both pfripr and pfralp1 are less polymorphic but the latter is 
comparatively more diverse, with varied number of regions having insertions and
deletions, asparagine and 6-mer repeats in the coding sequences. Pfgama and
pfmspdbl1 are polymorphic and genetically diverse among the isolates with
antibodies against the 3D7-based recombinant PfGAMA and PfMSPDBL1 inhibiting
merozoite invasion only in the 3D7 but not FVO strain. Moreover, although Abs
against the 3D7-based recombinant PfRipr and PfRALP1 proteins potently inhibited 
merozoite invasion of both 3D7 and FVO, the GIA activity of anti-PfRipr was much 
higher than that of anti-PfRALP1. Thus, PfRipr is regarded as a promising
blood-stage vaccine candidate for next-generation vaccines against P. falciparum.

Parasite proteins exported to the surface of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized
red blood cells (pRBCs) have a major role in severe malaria clinical
manifestation, where pRBC cytoadhesion and rosetting processes have been strongly
linked with microvascular sequestration while avoiding both spleen filtration and
immune surveillance. The parasite-derived and pRBC surface-exposed PfEMP1 protein
has been identified as one of the responsible elements for rosetting and,
therefore, considered as a promising vaccine candidate for the generation of
rosette-disrupting antibodies against severe malaria. However, the potential role
of anti-rosetting antibodies as targeting molecules for the functionalization of 
antimalarial drug-loaded nanovectors has never been studied. Our manuscript
presents a proof-of-concept study where the activity of an immunoliposomal
vehicle with a dual performance capable of specifically recognizing and
disrupting rosettes while simultaneously eliminating those pRBCs forming them has
been assayed in vitro. A polyclonal antibody against the NTS-DBL1α N-terminal
domain of a rosetting PfEMP1 variant has been selected as targeting molecule and 
lumefantrine as the antimalarial payload. After 30min incubation with 2μM
encapsulated drug, a 70% growth inhibition for all parasitic forms in culture
(IC50: 414nM) and a reduction in ca. 60% of those pRBCs with a rosetting
phenotype (IC50: 747nM) were achieved. This immunoliposomal approach represents
an innovative combination therapy for the improvement of severe malaria
therapeutics having a broader spectrum of activity than either anti-rosetting
antibodies or free drugs on their own.

BACKGROUND: The polymorphic nature of many malaria vaccine candidates presents
major challenges to achieving highly efficacious vaccines. Presently, there is
very little knowledge on the prevalence and patterns of functional immune
responses to polymorphic vaccine candidates in populations to guide vaccine
design. A leading polymorphic vaccine candidate against blood-stage Plasmodium
falciparum is apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), which is essential for
erythrocyte invasion. The importance of AMA1 as a target of acquired human
inhibitory antibodies, their allele specificity and prevalence in populations is 
unknown, but crucial for vaccine design.
METHODS: P. falciparum lines expressing different AMA1 alleles were genetically
engineered and used to quantify functional antibodies from two malaria-exposed
populations of adults and children. The acquisition of AMA1 antibodies was also
detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and competition ELISA
(using different AMA1 alleles) from the same populations.
RESULTS: We found that AMA1 was a major target of naturally acquired
invasion-inhibitory antibodies that were highly prevalent in malaria-endemic
populations and showed a high degree of allele specificity. Significantly, the
prevalence of inhibitory antibodies to different alleles varied substantially
within populations and between geographic locations. Inhibitory antibodies to
three specific alleles were highly prevalent (FVO and W2mef in Papua New Guinea; 
FVO and XIE in Kenya), identifying them for potential vaccine inclusion.
Measurement of antibodies by standard or competition ELISA was not strongly
predictive of allele-specific inhibitory antibodies. The patterns of
allele-specific functional antibody responses detected with our novel assays
may indicate that acquired immunity is elicited towards serotypes that are
prevalent in each geographic location.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new insights into the nature and acquisition 
of functional immunity to a polymorphic vaccine candidate and strategies to
quantify functional immunity in populations to guide rational vaccine design.

BACKGROUND: Current knowledge of human immunological responses to
pregnancy-associated malaria-specific Plasmodium falciparum protein VAR2CSA
concerns almost exclusively B cell-driven antibody-mediated activity. Knowledge
of VAR2CSA-specific T cell-mediated activity is minimal by comparison, with only 
a single published report of a study investigating VAR2CSA-derived
peptide-specific T cell responses. The study described here represents an attempt
to redress this balance.
METHODS: Within the framework of a cohort study of 1037 pregnant Beninese,
sub-groups were selected on the basis of the documented presence/absence of
infection with P. falciparum and conducted detailed immunological assessments
both at inclusion into the study and at delivery. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells were isolated, stimulated in vitro, and VAR2CSA DBL-5 domain-specific,
IFN-γ-secreting T-cell frequencies and cytokine responses were quantified using
flow cytometric techniques. Multivariate analyses were used to determine
primarily whether the T cell-mediated DBL5-specific activity measured was
associated with infection by P. falciparum adjusted for gravidity, anaemia and
other cofactors.
RESULTS: Infections with P. falciparum detected at inclusion were associated with
enhanced non-specific TNF responses, whilst diminished non-specific and
DBL-5-specific IL-10 responses were associated with infections detected at
delivery. Infections during pregnancy led to enhanced non-specific and
DBL-5-specific IFN-γ responses detectable at delivery but to concomitantly lower 
DBL-5-specific CD8+ IFN-γ responses. Prospective assessments indicated that
non-specific pro-inflammatory responses detectable at inclusion in the study were
associated with the occurrence of infections subsequently during pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings represent a first step in elucidating the quantity and 
quality of cellular immunological responses to VAR2CSA, which will help in the
development of the primary vaccine candidate for prevention of
pregnancy-associated malaria.

BACKGROUND: Immunological characterization of potential blood-stage malaria
antigens would be a valuable strategy in the development of an effective vaccine.
Identifying B and CD4(+) T cell epitopes will be important in understanding the
nature of immune response. A previous study has shown that Plasmodium falciparum 
apical asparagine-rich protein (PfAARP) stimulates immune response and induces
potent invasion-inhibitory antibodies. Antibodies to PfAARP provide synergistic
effects in inhibition of parasite invasion when used in combination with
antibodies to other antigens. In the present study, an attempt was made to
identify B cell and CD4(+) T cell epitopes of PfAARP.
METHODS: Balb/c mice were immunized with recombinant PfAARP and both cellular and
humoral responses were analysed at various time points. Computerized databases
[immune epitope database (IEDB) and B cell epitope prediction (BCEPred)] were
used to predict epitope sequences within PfAARP and predicted peptides were
synthesized. In addition, nine 18 amino acid, long-overlapping peptides spanning 
the entire length of PfAARP were synthesized. Using these peptides, B cell and
CD4(+) T cell responses in PfAARP immunized mice were measured by ELISA and
ELISPOT assays.
RESULTS: Here, it is demonstrated that immunization of mice with PfAARP induced
long-lasting, high-titre antibodies (4 months post immunization). Also, the
recombinant protein was effective in inducing a pronounced Th1 type of immune
response quantified by IFN-γ ELISA and ELISPOT. It was found that the predicted
peptides did not represent the immunogenic regions of PfAARP. However, of the
nine overlapping peptides, three peptides (peptides 3, 5 and 7) were strongly
recognized by PfAARP-immunized sera and represented B cell epitopes. Also,
peptide 3 elicited IFN- γ response, suggesting it to be a T-cell epitope.
CONCLUSIONS: Induction of long-lasting humoral and cellular response on PfAARP
immunization in mice underscores its possible use as a blood-stage malaria
vaccine candidate. Mapping of immunogenic regions may help in designing fusion
chimera containing immunologically relevant regions of other vaccine target
antigens and/or for multi-component vaccine candidates.

Regulatory T (Treg) cells have been shown in some cases to limit vaccine-specific
immune responses and impact efficacy. Very little is known about the regulatory
responses to the leading malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S. The goal of this study
was to begin to characterize the regulatory responses to the RTS,S vaccine. Using
multi-parameter flow cytometry, we examined responses in 13 malaria naïve adult
volunteers who received 2 doses of RTS,S given eight weeks apart. Five of these
volunteers had previously received 3 doses of a candidate DNA-CSP vaccine, with
the final dose given approximately one year prior to the first dose of the RTS,S 
vaccine. We found that the frequency of CD25(hi)Foxp3(+) Treg cells decreased
following administration of RTS,S (p=0.0195), with no differences based on
vaccine regimen. There was a concomitant decrease in CTLA-4 expression on
CD25(hi)Foxp3(+) Treg cells (p=0.0093) and PD-1 levels on CD8(+) T cells
(p=0.0002). Additionally, the frequency of anergic CTLA-4(+)CCR7(+) T cells
decreased following vaccination. An inverse correlation was observed between the 
frequency of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP)-specific
IFN-γ and PfCSP-specific IL-10, as well as an inverse correlation between IL-10
induced by Hepatitis B surface antigen, the carrier of RTS,S, and PfCSP-specific 
IFN-γ, suggesting that immunity against the vaccine backbone could impact vaccine
immunogenicity. These results have implications for future malaria vaccine
design.

Development of a Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) transmission blocking vaccine (TBV)
has the potential to significantly impact malaria control. Antibodies elicited
against sexual stage proteins in the human bloodstream are taken up with the
blood meal of the mosquitoes and inactivate parasite development in the mosquito.
In a phase 1 trial, a leading TBV identified as Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel® appeared
safe and immunogenic, however, the level of Pfs25-specific antibodies were likely
too low for an effective vaccine. Pfs230, a 230-kDa sexual stage protein
expressed in gametocytes is an alternative vaccine candidate. A unique
6-cysteine-rich domain structure within Pfs230 have thwarted its recombinant
expression and characterization for clinical evaluation for nearly a quarter of a
century. Here, we report on the identification, biochemical, biophysical, and
immunological characterization of recombinant Pfs230 domains. Rabbit antibodies
generated against recombinant Pfs230 domains blocked mosquito transmission of a
laboratory strain and two field isolates using an ex vivo assay. A planned
clinical trial of the Pfs230 vaccine is a significant step toward the potential
development of a transmission blocking vaccine to eliminate malaria.

SE36 antigen, derived from serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) of Plasmodium
falciparum, is a promising blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. Designated as
BK-SE36, the SE36 antigen was formulated with aluminum hydroxyl gel (AHG) and
produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) constraints. In a Phase Ib
clinical trial and follow-up study in Uganda, the risk for malaria symptoms was
reduced by 72% compared with the control group. Although promising, the number of
responders to the vaccine in 6-20years-olds was approximately 30% with the
majority in the younger cohort. This is in contrast to the phase Ia clinical
trial where response to the vaccine was 100% in Japanese malaria naive adults. A 
consideration that can be of importance is the involvement of host genetic
factors that may influence the ability to mount an effective immune response to
vaccination as well as susceptibility to malaria infection. We, therefore,
analyzed allelic polymorphism of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 alleles using
sequence-based typing (SBT). In this study, DRB1 alleles did not influence
antibody response to BK-SE36 and the vaccinees susceptibility to clinical
malaria.

BACKGROUND: The search for a vaccine against malaria caused by Plasmodium
falciparum has lasted for more than 100 years, with considerable progress in the 
identification of a number of vaccine candidates. The post-genomic era offers new
opportunities for an expedited search using rational vaccine design and
prioritization of key B-cell epitopes involved in natural acquired immunity.
METHODS: Malaria vaccine candidate genes that have reached clinical trial were
searched on an evolutionary relationship tree, to determine their level of
lineage-specificity. Ten other genes with similar protein features and level of
lineage specificity to the vaccine candidates were randomly selected, and
computationally evaluated for the presence of B-cell epitopes. The protein
fragment with maximum probability of putative epitopes were synthesized and used 
in an ELISA experiment to determine the presence of antibodies to these peptides,
in the serum of malaria patients and healthy malaria uninfected inhabitants from 
a malaria endemic region (Bolifamba), alongside with a vaccine candidate EBA-175.
RESULTS: Two peptide fragments of 25 and 30 amino acid length from PF3D7_1233400 
and PF3D7_1437500 respectively, coded as PF4-123 and PF4-143 were shown to
contain B-cell epitope(s). Total IgG antibodies to these peptides were not
significantly different between sick and healthy participants, but cytophilic
antibodies to these peptides were significantly higher in healthy participants
(p < 0.03). Total IgG to the vaccine candidate EBA-175 was significantly higher
in sick participants than in healthy participants, likewise cytophilic antibodies
(p < 0.04). Antibodies to the peptides PF4-123 and PF4-143 correlated negatively 
(p = 0.025 and 0.008 and r = -0.291 and -0.345, respectively) to parasite load.
Total IgG antibodies to EBA-175 showed a negative correlation to parasite load
(r = -0.144), which was not significant (p = 0.276). Duration of stay in
Bolifamba also negatively correlated with parasite load (p = 0.026, r = -0.419)
and total IgG to PF4-143 was significantly associated with prolonged duration of 
stay in the locality of Bolifamba, Cameroon (p = 0.006, r = 0.361).
CONCLUSIONS: The present study has identified two genes PF3D7_1233400 and
PF3D7_1437500 containing peptide fragment (PF4-123 and PF4-143) with B-cell
epitopes that are correlated with naturally acquired immunity to malaria. A
pipeline has been developed for rapid identification of other B-cell epitopes
involved in naturally acquired immunity.

Based on Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) from strain 
3D7, the malaria vaccine candidate FMP2.1/AS02A showed strain-specific efficacy
in a Phase 2 clinical trial in 400 Malian children randomized to 3 doses of the
AMA1 vaccine candidate or control rabies vaccine on days 0, 30 and 60. A subset
of 10 Pf(-) (i.e., no clinical malaria episodes) AMA1 recipients, 11 Pf(+)
(clinical malaria episodes with parasites with 3D7 or Fab9-type AMA1 cluster 1
loop [c1L]) AMA1 recipients, and 10 controls were randomly chosen for analysis.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated on days 0, 90 and 150 were
stimulated with full-length 3D7 AMA1 and c1L from strains 3D7 (c3D7) and Fab9
(cFab9). Production of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, and/or IL-17A was analyzed by flow
cytometry. Among AMA1 recipients, 18/21 evaluable samples stimulated with AMA1
demonstrated increased IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 derived from CD4(+) T cells by day 
150 compared to 0/10 in the control group (p<0.0001). Among AMA1 vaccines, CD4(+)
cells expressing both TNF-α and IL-2 were increased in Pf(-) children compared to
Pf(+) children. When PBMCs were stimulated with c3D7 and cFab9 separately, 4/18
AMA1 recipients with an AMA1-specific CD4(+) response had a significant response 
to one or both c1L. This suggests that recognition of the AMA1 antigen is not
dependent upon c1L alone. In summary, AMA1-specific T cell responses were notably
increased in children immunized with an AMA1-based vaccine candidate. The role of
CD4(+)TNF-α(+)IL-2(+)-expressing T cells in vaccine-induced strain-specific
protection against clinical malaria requires further exploration.

BACKGROUND: The production of properly folded, recombinant sub-unit Plasmodium
falciparum malaria vaccine candidates in sufficient quantities is often a
challenge. Success in vaccine immunogenicity studies in small animal models does 
not always predict immunogenicity in non-human primates and/or human subjects.
The aim of this study was to assess the immunogenicity of a chimeric blood-stage 
malaria vaccine in Aotus monkeys. This vaccine candidate includes the
neutralizing B cell epitopes of P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 1
(rPfMSP119) genetically linked to a highly immunogenic, well-conserved P.
falciparum merozoite surface protein 8 (rPfMSP8 (ΔAsn/Asp)) partner.
METHODS: Aotus nancymaae monkeys were immunized with purified rPfMSP1/8 or
rPfMSP8 (ΔAsn/Asp) formulated with Montanide ISA 720 as adjuvant, or with
adjuvant alone. Antibody responses to MSP119 and MSP8 domains were measured by
ELISA following primary, secondary and tertiary immunizations. The functionality 
of vaccine-induced antibodies was assessed in a standard P. falciparum
blood-stage in vitro growth inhibition assay. Non-parametric tests with
corrections for multiple comparisons when appropriate were used to determine the 
significance of differences in antigen-specific IgG titres and in parasite growth
inhibition.
RESULTS: The chimeric rPfMSP1/8 vaccine was shown to be well tolerated and highly
immunogenic with boost-able antibody responses elicited to both PfMSP8 and
PfMSP119 domains. Elicited antibodies were highly cross-reactive between FVO and 
3D7 alleles of PfMSP119 and potently inhibited the in vitro growth of P.
falciparum blood-stage parasites.
CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous results with inbred and outbred mice and with
rabbits, the PfMSP1/8 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in eliciting P.
falciparum growth inhibitory antibodies upon immunization of non-human primates. 
The data support the further assessment of PfMSP1/8 as a component of a
multivalent vaccine for use in human subjects. As important, the data indicate
that rPfMSP8 (ΔAsn/Asp) can be used as a malaria specific carrier protein to: (1)
drive production of antibody responses to neutralizing B cell epitopes of
heterologous vaccine candidates and (2) facilitate production of properly folded,
recombinant P. falciparum subunit vaccines in high yield.

The importance of host and parasite genetic factors in malaria resistance or
susceptibility has been investigated since the middle of the last century.
Nowadays, of all diseases that affect man, malaria still plays one of the highest
levels of selective pressure on human genome. Susceptibility to malaria depends
on exposure profile, epidemiological characteristics, and several components of
the innate and adaptive immune system that influences the quality of the immune
response generated during the Plasmodium lifecycle in the vertebrate host. But it
is well known that the parasite's enormous capacity of genetic variation in
conjunction with the host genetics polymorphism is also associated with a wide
spectrum of susceptibility degrees to complicated or severe forms of the disease.
In this scenario, variations in genes of the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) associated with host resistance or susceptibility to malaria have been
identified and used as markers in host-pathogen interaction studies, mainly those
evaluating the impact on the immune response, acquisition of resistance, or
increased susceptibility to infection or vulnerability to disease. However, due
to the intense selective pressure, number of cases, and mortality rates, the
majority of the reported associations reported concerned Plasmodium falciparum
malaria. Studies on the MHC polymorphism and its association with Plasmodium
vivax, which is the most widespread Plasmodium and the most prevalent species
outside the African continent, are less frequent but equally important. Despite
punctual contributions, there are accumulated evidences of human genetic control 
in P. vivax infection and disease. Herein, we review the current knowledge in the
field of MHC and derived molecules (HLA Class I, Class II, TNF-α, LTA, BAT1, and 
CTL4) regarding P. vivax malaria. We discuss particularly the results of P. vivax
studies on HLA class I and II polymorphisms in relation to host susceptibility,
naturally acquired immune response against specific antigens and the implication 
of this knowledge to overcome the parasite immune evasion. Finally, the potential
impact of such polymorphisms on the development of vaccine candidate antigens
against P. vivax will be studied.

Although it is more than a decade since the parasite genome information was
obtained, standardized novel genome-wide selection/prioritization strategies for 
candidacy of malaria vaccine antigens are still sought. In the quest to
systematically identify candidates, it is impossible to overemphasize the
usefulness of wheat germ cell-free technology in expressing quality proteins for 
the post-genome vaccine candidate discovery.

Despite recent progress with GSK's RTS,S malaria vaccine, there remains a
desperate need for an efficient malaria vaccine. We have used a repetitive
antigen display technology to display malaria specific B cell and T cell epitopes
in an effort to design a vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Our
protein sequence when assembled into a nanoparticle induces strong, long-lived
and protective immune responses against infection with the parasite. We are
confident that the clinical trials with our most developed vaccine candidate will
show good protection in a controlled human malaria infection trial.

Malaria vaccine development has largely focused on Plasmodium falciparum;
however, a reawakening to the importance of Plasmodium vivax has spurred efforts 
to develop vaccines against this difficult to treat and at times severe form of
relapsing malaria, which constitutes a significant proportion of human malaria
cases worldwide. The almost complete dependence of P. vivax red blood cell
invasion on the interaction of the P. vivax Duffy-binding protein region II
(PvDBP_RII) with the human Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) makes
this antigen an attractive vaccine candidate against blood-stage P. vivax. Here, 
we generated both preclinical and clinically compatible adenoviral and poxviral
vectored vaccine candidates expressing the Salvador I allele of PvDBP_RII -
including human adenovirus serotype 5 (HAdV5), chimpanzee adenovirus serotype 63 
(ChAd63), and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors. We report on the
antibody and T cell immunogenicity of these vaccines in mice or rabbits, either
used alone in a viral vectored prime-boost regime or in "mixed-modality"
adenovirus prime - protein-in--adjuvant boost regimes (using a recombinant
PvDBP_RII protein antigen formulated in Montanide(®)ISA720 or Abisco(®)100
adjuvants). Antibodies induced by these regimes were found to bind to native
parasite antigen from P. vivax infected Thai patients and were capable of
inhibiting the binding of PvDBP_RII to its receptor DARC using an in vitro
binding inhibition assay. In recent years, recombinant ChAd63 and MVA vectors
have been quickly translated into human clinical trials for numerous antigens
from P. falciparum as well as a growing number of other pathogens. The vectors
reported here are immunogenic in small animals, elicit antibodies against
PvDBP_RII, and have recently entered clinical trials, which will provide the
first assessment of the safety and immunogenicity of the PvDBP_RII antigen in
humans.

BACKGROUND: The targets and mechanisms of human immunity to malaria are poorly
understood, which poses a major barrier to malaria vaccine development.
Antibodies play a key role in human immunity and may act by inhibiting
receptor-binding functions of key merozoite invasion ligands. Antibodies to the
major invasion ligand and vaccine candidate, erythrocyte-binding antigen 175
(EBA-175), have been linked with protection, but how these antibodies function
has not been established.
METHODS: We developed 2 new assays that quantify the ability of antibodies to
inhibit binding of EBA-175 to its erythrocyte receptor, glycophorin A, using
either native or recombinant EBA-175. Binding-inhibitory antibodies were
evaluated in a longitudinal cohort study of Papua New Guinean children and
related to risk of malaria, age, infection status, and markers of parasite
exposure.
RESULTS: Binding-inhibition assays (BIAs) were reproducible, and the 2 assays had
a high level of agreement. Inhibitory antibodies were common among children,
acquired in association with markers of increasing parasite exposure, and high in
those children with active infection. Inhibitory antibodies correlated with total
immunoglobulin G levels to the EBA-175 binding domain (region II). Importantly,
binding-inhibitory antibodies were significantly associated with protection from 
symptomatic malaria when measured using either BIA.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that naturally acquired binding-inhibitory
antibodies are an important functional mechanism that contributes to protection
against malaria and further supports the potential of EBA-175 as a vaccine
candidate. Identifying vaccines and approaches that induce potent
binding-inhibitory antibodies may be a valuable strategy in the development of
highly efficacious malaria vaccines.

With drug resistance to available therapeutics continuing to develop against
Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the development of an effective vaccine candidate 
remains a major research goal. Successful interruption of invasion of parasites
into erythrocytes during the blood stage of infection will prevent the severe
clinical symptoms and complications associated with malaria. Previously studied
blood stage antigens have highlighted the hurdles that are inherent to this
life-cycle stage, namely that highly immunogenic antigens are also globally
diverse, resulting in protection only against the vaccine strain, or that
naturally acquired immunity to blood stage antigens do not always correlate with 
actual protection. The blood stage antigen reticulocyte binding homolog RH5 is
essential for parasite viability, has globally limited diversity, and is
associated with protection from disease. Here we summarize available information 
on this invasion ligand and recent findings that highlight its candidacy for
inclusion in a blood-stage malaria vaccine.

PfRH5 has recently emerged as a strong vaccine candidate for Plasmodium
falciparum malaria. Antibodies inhibit invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites and
blood-stage replication, and PfRH5 is a significant target of acquired human
immunity. Recent studies have shown protective efficacy of PfRH5 vaccines in a
non-human primate model of malaria.

Rodent malaria is a useful model for evaluating the efficacy of malaria vaccine
candidates; however, labor-intensive microscopic parasite counting hampers the
use of an in vivo parasite challenge in high-throughput screening. The
measurement of malaria parasite lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) activity, which is
commonly used in the in vitro growth inhibition assay of Plasmodium falciparum,
may be the cheapest and simplest alternative to microscopic parasite counting.
However, the pLDH assay has not been applied in the in vivo rodent malaria model.
Here, we showed that the pLDH assay is reliable and accurately determines
parasitemia in the rodent malaria model. pLDH activity measured using a
chromogenic substrate reflects the parasite number in the blood; it allows fast
and easy assessment using a conventional microplate reader. To validate this
approach, we synthesized recombinant PyMSP1-19 protein (rPyMSP1-19) using a wheat
germ cell-free protein synthesis system and immunized mice with rPyMSP1-19. The
antisera showed specific reactivity on the surface of the Plasmodium yoelii
merozoite and immunized mice were protected against a lethal P. yoelii 17 XL
challenge. The pLDH assay quickly and easily demonstrated a significant reduction
of the parasite numbers in the immunized mice. Accordingly, the pLDH assay proved
to be an efficient alternative to rodent malaria parasite counting, and may
therefore accelerate in vivo vaccine candidate screening.

Erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites is a highly intricate
process in which Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding-like homologous
protein 5 (PfRH5) is an indispensable parasite ligand that binds with its
erythrocyte receptor, Basigin. PfRH5 is a leading blood-stage vaccine candidate
because it exhibits limited polymorphisms and elicits potent strain-transcending 
parasite neutralizing antibodies. However, the mechanism by which it is anchored 
to the merozoite surface remains unknown because both PfRH5 and the
PfRH5-interacting protein (PfRipr) lack transmembrane domains and GPI anchors.
Here we have identified a conserved GPI-linked parasite protein, Cysteine-rich
protective antigen (CyRPA) as an interacting partner of PfRH5-PfRipr that tethers
the PfRH5/PfRipr/CyRPA multiprotein complex on the merozoite surface. CyRPA was
demonstrated to be GPI-linked, localized in the micronemes, and essential for
erythrocyte invasion. Specific antibodies against the three proteins successfully
detected the intact complex in the parasite and coimmunoprecipitated the three
interacting partners. Importantly, full-length CyRPA antibodies displayed potent 
strain-transcending invasion inhibition, as observed for PfRH5. CyRPA does not
bind with erythrocytes, suggesting that its parasite neutralizing antibodies
likely block its critical interaction with PfRH5-PfRipr, leading to a blockade of
erythrocyte invasion. Further, CyRPA and PfRH5 antibody combinations produced
synergistic invasion inhibition, suggesting that simultaneous blockade of the
PfRH5-Basigin and PfRH5/PfRipr/CyRPA interactions produced an enhanced inhibitory
effect. Our discovery of the critical interactions between PfRH5, PfRipr, and the
GPI-anchored CyRPA clearly defines the components of the essential PfRH5 adhesion
complex for P. falciparum erythrocyte invasion and offers it as a previously
unidentified potent target for antimalarial strategies that could abrogate
formation of the crucial multiprotein complex.

Malaria transmission blocking vaccines (TBV) directed against proteins expressed 
on sexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum in the mosquito midgut are considered
an effective means to reduce malaria transmission. Antibodies induced by TBV
block sporogonic development in the mosquito, and thus transmission to the next
human host. The Pfs25 protein, expressed on the surface of gametes, zygotes and
ookinetes, is one of the primary targets for TBV development. Using a plant
virus-based transient expression system, we have successfully produced Pfs25
fused to a modified lichenase (LicKM) carrier in Nicotiana benthamiana, purified 
and characterized the protein (Pfs25-FhCMB), and evaluated this vaccine candidate
in animal models for the induction of transmission blocking antibodies. Soluble
Pfs25-FhCMB was expressed in plants at a high level, and induced transmission
blocking antibodies that persisted for up to 6 months post immunization in mice
and rabbits. These data demonstrate the potential of the new malaria vaccine
candidate and also support feasibility of expressing Plasmodium antigens in a
plant-based system.

Despite global efforts to control malaria, the illness remains a significant
public health threat. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine against malaria,
but an efficacious vaccine would represent an important public health tool for
successful malaria elimination. Malaria vaccine development continues to be
hindered by a poor understanding of antimalarial immunity, a lack of an immune
correlate of protection, and the genetic diversity of malaria parasites. Current 
vaccine development efforts largely target Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the
pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stages, with some research on
transmission-blocking vaccines against asexual stages and vaccines against
pregnancy-associated malaria. The leading pre-erythrocytic vaccine candidate is
RTS,S, and early results of ongoing Phase 3 testing show overall efficacy of 46% 
against clinical malaria. The next steps for malaria vaccine development will
focus on the design of a product that is efficacious against the highly diverse
strains of malaria and the identification of a correlate of protection against
disease.

A highly efficacious pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine would be an important tool
for the control and elimination of malaria but is currently unavailable.
High-level protection in humans can be achieved by experimental immunization with
Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites attenuated by radiation or under anti-malarial 
drug coverage. Immunization with genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) would be 
an attractive alternative approach. In this study, we present data on safety and 
protective efficacy using sporozoites with deletions of two genes, that is the
newly identified b9 and slarp, which govern independent and critical processes
for successful liver-stage development. In the rodent malaria model,
PbΔb9ΔslarpGAP was completely attenuated showing no breakthrough infections while
efficiently inducing high-level protection. The human PfΔb9ΔslarpGAP generated
without drug resistance markers were infective to human hepatocytes in vitro and 
to humanized mice engrafted with human hepatocytes in vivo but completely aborted
development after infection. These findings support the clinical development of a
PfΔb9ΔslarpSPZ vaccine.

BACKGROUND: Persons with blood-stage Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in the
absence of symptoms are considered to be clinically immune. We hypothesized that 
asymptomatic subjects with P. falciparum parasitemia would differentially
recognize a subset of P. falciparum proteins on a genomic scale.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Compared with symptomatic subjects, sera from clinically
immune, asymptomatically infected individuals differentially recognized 51 P.
falciparum proteins, including the established vaccine candidate PfMSP1. Novel,
hitherto unstudied hypothetical proteins and other proteins not previously
recognized as potential vaccine candidates were also differentially recognized.
Genes encoding the proteins differentially recognized by the Peruvian clinically 
immune individuals exhibited a significant enrichment of nonsynonymous nucleotide
variation, an observation consistent with these genes undergoing immune
selection.
CONCLUSIONS: A limited set of P. falciparum protein antigens was associated with 
the development of naturally acquired clinical immunity in the low-transmission
setting of the Peruvian Amazon. These results imply that, even in a
low-transmission setting, an asexual blood-stage vaccine designed to reduce
clinical malaria symptoms will likely need to contain large numbers of
often-polymorphic proteins, a finding at odds with many current efforts in the
design of vaccines against asexual blood-stage P. falciparum.

One of the most promising malaria vaccine candidate antigens is the Plasmodium
falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1). Several studies have shown that
this blood-stage antigen can induce strong parasite growth inhibitory antibody
responses. PfAMA1 contains up to six recognition sites for N-linked
glycosylation, a post-translational modification that is absent in P. falciparum.
To prevent any potential negative impact of N-glycosylation, the recognition
sites have been knocked out in most PfAMA1 variants expressed in eukaryotic
hosts. However, N-linked glycosylation may increase efficacy by improving
immunogenicity and/or focusing the response towards relevant epitopes by glycan
masking. We describe the production of glycosylated and nonglycosylated PfAMA1 in
Nicotiana benthamiana and its detailed characterization in terms of yield,
integrity and protective efficacy. Both PfAMA1 variants accumulated to high
levels (>510 μg/g fresh leaf weight) after transient expression, and
high-mannose-type N-glycans were confirmed for the glycosylated variant. No
significant differences between the N. benthamiana and Pichia pastoris PfAMA1
variants were detected in conformation-sensitive ligand-binding studies. Specific
titres of >2 × 10(6) were induced in rabbits, and strong reactivity with P.
falciparum schizonts was observed in immunofluorescence assays, as well as up to 
100% parasite growth inhibition for both variants, with IC₅₀ values of ~35 μg/mL.
Competition assays indicated that a number of epitopes were shielded from immune 
recognition by N-glycans, warranting further studies to determine how
glycosylation can be used for the directed targeting of immune responses. These
results highlight the potential of plant transient expression systems as a
production platform for vaccine candidates.

antigens.

After more than 50 years of intensive research and development, only one malaria 
vaccine candidate, "RTS,S," has progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials. Despite
only partial efficacy, this candidate is now forecast to become the first
licensed malaria vaccine. Hence, more efficacious second-generation malaria
vaccines that can significantly reduce transmission are urgently needed. This
review will focus on a major obstacle hindering development of effective malaria 
vaccines: parasite antigenic diversity. Despite extensive genetic diversity in
leading candidate antigens, vaccines have been and continue to be formulated
using recombinant antigens representing only one or two strains. These vaccine
strains represent only a small fraction of the diversity circulating in natural
parasite populations, leading to escape of non-vaccine strains and challenging
investigators' abilities to measure strain-specific efficacy in vaccine trials.
Novel strategies are needed to overcome antigenic diversity in order for vaccine 
development to succeed. Many studies have now cataloged the global diversity of
leading Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax vaccine antigens. In this
review, we describe how population genetic approaches can be applied to this rich
data source to predict the alleles that best represent antigenic diversity,
polymorphisms that contribute to it, and to identify key polymorphisms associated
with antigenic escape. We also suggest an approach to summarize the known global 
diversity of a given antigen to predict antigenic diversity, how to select
variants that best represent the strains circulating in natural parasite
populations and how to investigate the strain-specific efficacy of vaccine
trials. Use of these strategies in the design and monitoring of vaccine trials
will not only shed light on the contribution of genetic diversity to the
antigenic diversity of malaria, but will also maximize the potential of future
malaria vaccine candidates.

Emerging evidence suggests that antibodies against merozoite proteins involved in
Plasmodium falciparum invasion into the red blood cell (RBC) play an important
role in clinical immunity to malaria. The protein family of parasite antigens
known as P. falciparum reticulocyte binding protein-like homolog (PfRh) is
required for RBC invasion. PfRh5 is the only member within the PfRh family that
cannot be genetically deleted, suggesting it plays an essential role in parasite 
survival. This antigen forms a complex with the cysteine-rich P. falciparum Rh5
interacting protein (PfRipr), on the merozoite surface during RBC invasion. The
PfRh5 ectodomain sequence and a C-terminal fragment of PfRipr were cloned and
expressed in Escherichia coli and baculovirus-infected cells, respectively.
Immunization of rabbits with these recombinant proteins induced antibodies able
to inhibit growth of various P. falciparum strains. Antibody responses to these
proteins were investigated in a treatment-re-infection study conducted in an
endemic area of Papua New Guinea (PNG) to determine their contribution to
naturally acquired immunity. Antibody titers to PfRh5 but not PfRipr showed
strong association with protection against P. falciparum clinical episodes. When 
associations with time-to-first infection were analyzed, high antibody levels
against PfRh5 were also found to be associated with protection from high-density 
infections but not from re-infection. Together these results indicate that PfRh5 
is an important target of protective immunity and constitutes a promising vaccine
candidate.

Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 3: oligomerization,
self-assembly, and heme complex formation.

and Biotechnology, New Delhi 110067, India.

Merozoite surface protein 3 of Plasmodium falciparum, a 40-kDa protein that also 
binds heme, has been biophysically characterized for its tendency to form highly 
elongated oligomers. This study aims to systematically analyze the regions in
MSP3 sequence involved in oligomerization and correlate its aggregation tendency 
with its high affinity for binding with heme. Through size exclusion
chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy,
we have found that MSP3, previously known to form elongated oligomers, actually
forms self-assembled filamentous structures that possess amyloid-like
characteristics. By expressing different regions of MSP3, we observed that the
previously described leucine zipper region at the C terminus of MSP3 may not be
the only structural element responsible for oligomerization and that other
peptide segments like MSP3(192-196) (YILGW) may also be required. MSP3 aggregates
on incubation were transformed to long unbranched amyloid fibrils. Using
immunostaining methods, we found that 5-15-μm-long fibrillar structures stained
by anti-MSP3 antibodies were attached to the merozoite surface and also
associated with erythrocyte membrane. We also found MSP3 to bind several
molecules of heme by UV spectrophotometry, HPLC, and electrophoresis. This study 
suggested that its ability to bind heme is somehow related to its inherent
characteristics to form oligomers. Moreover, heme interaction with a surface
protein like MSP3, which does not participate in hemozoin formation, may suggest 
a protective role against the heme released from unprocessed hemoglobin released 
after schizont egress. These studies point to the other roles that MSP3 may play 
during the blood stages of the parasite, in addition to be an important vaccine
candidate.

Oxygen distribution in proteins defines functional significance of the genome and
proteome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum 3D7.

Although GlaxoSmithKline is on the way to launch the new vaccine candidate 'RTS, 
S', the search for suitable antimalarial drugs still remains an exceeding
challenge because Plasmodium falciparum-mediated malaria is one of the most
lethal diseases in the world. Novel innovative ideas are required to identify new
potential molecular targets to be able to fight this lethal parasite efficiently.
We used an unconventional bioinformatics approach to analyze the entire genome
and proteome of the Pf3D7 strain. Because the oxygen (O-) content is a decisive
parameter that determines the function of a protein, we analyzed the entire Pf3D7
proteome based on O-containing amino acid expression. Our data disclose a total
of four proteins encoded by chromosome (Chr)-4 and Chr-9 that have an outstanding
O-controlled character. The identification of the biological significance of
these proteins could eventually lead to new vital drug targets.

New tools are required to expedite the development of an effective vaccine
against the blood-stage infection with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum. This work describes the assessment of the ADRB assay in a mouse
model, characterizing the functional interaction between antimalarial serum
antibodies and FcRs upon neutrophils. We describe a reproducible,
antigen-specific assay, dependent on functional FcR signaling, and show that ADRB
activity is induced equally by IgG1 and IgG2a isotypes and is modulated by
blocking FcR function. However, following immunization of mice with the
blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen MSP142, no measurable ADRB activity was
induced against PEMS and neither was vaccine efficacy modulated against
Plasmodium yoelii blood-stage challenge in γ(-/-) mice compared with WT mice. In 
contrast, following a primary, nonlethal P. yoelii parasite challenge, serum from
vaccinated mice and nonimmunized controls showed anti-PEMS ADRB activity. Upon
secondary challenge, nonimmunized γ(-/-) mice showed a reduced ability to control
blood-stage parasitemia compared with immunized γ(-/-) mice; however, WT mice,
depleted of their neutrophils, did not lose their ability to control infection.
Thus, whereas neutrophil-induced ADRB against PEMS does not appear to play a role
in protection against P. yoelii rodent malaria, induction of ADRB activity after 
challenge suggests that antigen targets of anti-PEMS ADRB activity remain to be
established, as well as further supporting the observation that ADRB activity to 
P. falciparum arises following repeated natural exposure.

Genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum is intimately associated with
morbidity, mortality and malaria control strategies. It is therefore imperative
to study genetic makeup and population structure of this parasite in endemic
areas. In Kong Mong Tha, an isolated village in western Thailand, the majority of
P. falciparum infections are asymptomatic. In this study we investigated
complexity of infections and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P.
falciparum population of Kong Mong Tha, and compared results with those
previously obtained from Mae Sod, in northwestern Thailand, where the majority of
infections were symptomatic. Using PCR-based determination of the 5' merozoite
surface protein 1 gene (msp1) recombinant types, we found that 39% of 59 P.
falciparum isolates from Kong Mong Tha had multiple 5' recombinant types with a
mean number of 1.54. These values were much lower than those obtained from Mae
Sod: 96% for multiple infections and with a mean number of 3.61. Analysis of
full-length sequences of two housekeeping genes, the P-type Ca(2+)-transporting
ATPase gene (n=33) plus adenylosuccinate lyase gene (n=33), and three vaccine
candidate antigen genes, msp1 (n=26), the circumsporozoite protein gene, csp
(n=30) and the apical membrane antigen 1 gene, ama 1 (n=32), revealed that in all
of these genes within-population SNP diversity was at similar levels between Kong
Mong Tha and Mae Sod, suggesting that the extent of MOI and clinical
manifestations of malaria are not strongly associated with genetic diversity.
Additionally, we did not detect significant genetic differentiation between the
two parasite populations, as estimated by the Wright's fixation index of
inter-population variance in allele frequencies, suggesting that gene flow
prevented the formation of population structuring. Thus, this study highlights
unique features of P. falciparum populations in Thailand. The implications of
these finding are discussed.

Biochemical analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen-175
(EBA175)-glycophorin-A interaction: implications for vaccine design.

PfEBA175 has an important role in the invasion of human erythrocytes by
Plasmodium falciparum and is therefore considered a high priority blood-stage
malaria vaccine candidate. PfEBA175 mediates adhesion to erythrocytes through
binding of the Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains in its extracellular domain to
Neu5Acα2-3Gal displayed on the O-linked glycans of glycophorin-A (GYPA). Because 
of the difficulties in expressing active full-length (FL) P. falciparum proteins 
in a recombinant form, previous analyses of the PfEBA175-GYPA interaction have
largely focused on the DBL domains alone, and therefore they have not been
performed in the context of the native protein sequence. Here, we express the
entire ectodomain of PfEBA175 (PfEBA175 FL) in soluble form, allowing us to
compare the biochemical and immunological properties with a fragment containing
only the tandem DBL domains ("region II," PfEBA175 RII). Recombinant PfEBA175 FL 
bound human erythrocytes in a trypsin and neuraminidase-sensitive manner and
recognized Neu5Acα2-3Gal-containing glycans, confirming its biochemical activity.
A quantitative binding analysis showed that PfEBA175 FL interacted with native
GYPA with a KD ∼0.26 μM and is capable of self-association. By comparison, the
RII fragment alone bound GYPA with a lower affinity demonstrating that regions
outside of the DBL domains are important for interactions with GYPA; antibodies
directed to these other regions also contributed to the inhibition of parasite
invasion. These data demonstrate the importance of PfEBA175 regions other than
the DBL domains in the interaction with GYPA and merit their inclusion in an
EBA175-based vaccine.

clinical malaria.

BACKGROUND: Elucidating the mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity to
Plasmodium falciparum infections would be highly valuable for malaria vaccine
development. Asymptomatic multiclonal infections have been shown to predict
protection from clinical malaria in a transmission-dependent manner, but the
mechanisms underlying this are unclear. We assessed the breadth of antibody
responses to several vaccine candidate merozoite antigens in relation to the
infecting parasite population and clinical immunity.
METHODS: In a cohort study in Tanzania, 320 children aged 1-16 years who were
asymptomatic at baseline were included. We genotyped P. falciparum infections by 
targeting the msp2 gene using polymerase chain reaction and capillary
electrophoresis and measured antibodies to 7 merozoite antigens using a multiplex
assay. We assessed the correlation between the number of clones and the breadth
of the antibody response, and examined their effects on the risk of malaria
during 40 weeks of follow-up using age-adjusted multivariate regression models.
RESULTS: The antibody breadth was positively correlated with the number of clones
(RR [risk ratio], 1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32-2.02). Multiclonal
infections were associated with a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of malaria
in the absence of antibodies (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, .29-2.34). The breadth of the
antibody response was significantly associated with a reduced risk of malaria in 
the absence of infections (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, .09-.66). In combination, these
factors were associated with a lower risk of malaria than they were individually 
(RR, 0.14; 95% CI, .04-.48).
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that malaria vaccines mimicking naturally
acquired immunity should ideally induce antibody responses that can be boosted by
natural infections.

Plasmodium falciparum is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects
erythrocytes and hepatocytes. The blood stage of its life cycle causes
substantial morbidity and mortality associated with millions of infections each
year, motivating an intensive search for potential components of a multi-subunit 
vaccine. In this study, we present data showing that antibodies from natural
infections can recognize a recombinant form of the relatively conserved merozoite
surface antigen, PfRH5. Furthermore, we performed invasion inhibition assays on
clinical isolates and laboratory strains of P. falciparum in the presence of
affinity purified antibodies to RH5 and show that these antibodies can inhibit
invasion in vitro.

falciparum malaria vaccines.

In the absence of any highly effective vaccine candidate against Plasmodium
falciparum malaria, it remains imperative for the field to pursue all avenues
that may lead to the successful development of such a formulation. The
development of a subunit vaccine targeting the asexual blood-stage of Plasmodium 
falciparum malaria infection has proven particularly challenging with only
limited success to date in clinical trials. However, only a fraction of potential
blood-stage vaccine antigens have been evaluated as targets, and a number of new 
promising candidate antigen formulations and delivery platforms are approaching
clinical development. It is therefore essential that reliable and sensitive
methods of detecting, or ruling out, even modest efficacy of blood-stage vaccines
in small clinical trials be established. In this article we evaluate the
challenges facing blood-stage vaccine developers, assess the appropriateness and 
limitations of various in vivo approaches for efficacy assessment and suggest
future directions for the field.

The SE36 antigen, derived from serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) of Plasmodium
falciparum, is a promising blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. Ongoing
clinical trials suggest the efficacy of the SE36 vaccine could be increased by
the incorporation of more effective adjuvants into the vaccine formulation. In
this study, we assessed the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of
SE36/AHG formulated with TLR9 ligand adjuvants K3 CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotides
(CpG ODNs) (K3 ODN), D3 ODN or synthetic hemozoin, in two non-human primate
models. SE36/AHG with or without each adjuvant was administrated to cynomolgus
monkeys. A combination of TLR9 ligand adjuvant with SE36/AHG induced higher
humoral and cellular immune response compared with SE36/AHG alone. Administration
of a crude extract of P. falciparum parasite resulted in the induction of more
SE36-specific IgG antibodies in monkeys vaccinated with a combination of SE36/AHG
and adjuvant, as opposed to vaccination with SE36/AHG alone. The most effective
TLR9 ligand, K3 ODN, was chosen for further vaccine trials in squirrel monkeys,
in combination with SE36/AHG. All monkeys immunized with the combined SE36/AHG
and K3 ODN formulation effectively suppressed parasitemia and symptoms of malaria
following challenge infections. Furthermore, no serious adverse events were
observed. Our results show that the novel vaccine formulation of K3 ODN with
SE36/AHG demonstrates safety, potent immunogenicity and efficacy in nonhuman
primates, and this vaccine formulation may form the basis of a more effective
malaria vaccine.

Malaria is an infectious disease that threatens half of the world's population.
This debilitating disease is caused by infection from parasites of the genus
Plasmodium. Insecticides, bed nets and drug therapies have lowered the prevalence
and death rate associated with malaria but this disease continues to plague many 
populations around the world. In recent years, many organizations have suggested 
developing methods for a complete eradication of malaria. The most
straightforward and effective method for this potential eradication will be
through the development of a low-cost vaccine. To achieve eradication, it will be
necessary to develop new vaccine candidates and novel systems for both the
production and delivery of these vaccines. Recently, the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been used for the recombinant expression of malaria
vaccine candidates including the transmission blocking vaccine candidate
Pfs48/45. Here, we discuss the potential of this research on the future
development of a low-cost malaria vaccine candidate.

Identification and characterization of merozoite surface protein 1 epitope.

Singh SP, Mishra BN.

Malaria is an important tropical infection which urgently requires intervention
of an effective vaccine. Antigenic variations of the parasite and allelic
diversity of the host are main problems in the development of an effective
malaria vaccine. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) directed against Plasmodium
falciparum-derived antigens are shown to play an important role for the
protection against malaria. The merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) is expressed
in all the four life-cycle stages of Plasmodium falciparum and did not find any
sequence similarity to human and mouse reference proteins. MSP1 is a known target
of the immune response and a single CTL epitope binding to the HLA-A*0201 is
available for merozoite form. Here, we report the results from the computational 
characterization of MSP1, precursor (1720 residue) and screening of highest
scoring potential CTL epitopes for 1712 overlapping peptides binding to thirty
four HLA class-I alleles and twelve HLA class-I supertypes (5 HLA-A and 7 HLA-B) 
using bioinformatics tools. Supertypes are the clustered groups of HLA class-I
molecules, representing a sets of molecules that share largely overlapping
peptide binding specificity. The prediction results for MSP1 as adhesin and
adhesin-like in terms of probability is 1.0. Results also show that MSP1 has
orthologs to other related species as well as having non allergenicity and single
transmembrane properties demonstrating its suitability as a vaccine candidate.
The predicted peptides are expected to be useful in the design of multi-epitope
vaccines without compromising the human population coverage.
